A five-step review approach was adopted to search and analyze peer-reviewed academic journal articles. A three-level computer vision development framework was proposed to categorized computer vision applications in the construction industry. The links between computer vision and three main safety research traditions: safety management system, behavior-based safety program, and safety culture, were discussed. The results suggest that the majority of past efforts were focused on object recognition, object tracking, and action recognition, with limited research focused on recognizing unsafe behavior. There are even fewer studies aimed at developing vision-based safety assessment and prediction systems. Based on the review findings, four future research directions are suggested: (1) develop and test a behavioral-cues-based safety climate measure, (2) develop safety behavior datasets, (3) develop a formal hazard identification and assessment model, and (4) develop criteria to evaluate the real impacts of vision-based technologies on safety performance.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": false, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000610188700022"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "MAR 2021", "vol": "135", "pubyear": "2021", "sortdate": "2021-01-06", "pubmonth": "MAR", "pubtype": "Journal", "pubdate": "MAR 2021", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "", "page_count": "14", "early_access_date": "JAN 2021", "early_access_month": "01", "early_access_year": "2021"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 38, "WOSCC": 38}, "cc_counts": {"ALLFUNC": 11, "background": 9, "basis": 0, "support": 0, "differ": 0, "discuss": 3}, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "4", "content": "Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Computer Science"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "4.224", "content": "Design & Manufacturing"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "4.224.599", "content": "Project Scheduling"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "09 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {}, "ref_count": 148, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000610188700022", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2021", "edition": ["WOS.SCI", "WOS.SSCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:000610188700022", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["CCC.CCCT"], "coll_id": "CCC"}, {"uid": "CABI:20210027441", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["CABI.ABSTRACTS", "CABI.HEALTH"], "coll_id": "CABI"}, {"uid": "INSPEC:20721400", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["INSPEC.INSPEC"], "coll_id": "INSPEC"}], "ut": "WOS:000610188700022"}, "3": {"doctypes": ["Review"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "1911807", "last_name": "Zhong", "wos_standard": "Zhong, BT", "first_name": "Botao"}, {"daisng_id": "3884634", "last_name": "Wu", "wos_standard": "Wu, HT", "first_name": "Haitao"}, null, {"daisng_id": "42447464", "last_name": "Jiao", "wos_standard": "Jiao, L", "first_name": "Li"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "Mapping computer vision research in construction: Developments, knowledge gaps and implications for research"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMAT CONSTR"}]}}, "docid": "594712877", "colluid": "WOS:000494887600001", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "0000000213196742"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "0926-5805"}, {"type": "eissn", "value": "1872-7891"}, {"type": "art_no", "value": "ARTN 102919"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102919"}], "doi": "10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102919", "jcrKey": "ISSN:0926-5805", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>Computer vision is transforming processes associated with the engineering and management of construction projects.

With advances being made in computer vision, the capability exists to automatically capture and identify unsafe behaviour and hazards in real-time from two-dimensional (2D) digital images/videos. The corollary developments in computer vision have stimulated a wealth of research in construction to examine its potential application to practice. Hindering the application of computer vision in construction has been its inability to accurately, and generalise the detection of objects. To address this shortcoming, developments in deep learning have provided computer vision with the ability to improve the accuracy, reliability and ability to generalise object detection and therefore its usage in construction. In this paper we review the developments of computer vision studies that have been used to identify unsafe behaviour from 2D images that arises on construction sites. Then, in light of advances made with deep learning, we examine and discuss its integration with computer vision to support BBS.

However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review. This architecture innovatively introduces computer vision as a sensing method of construction sites, and realizes low-cost and non-invasive information acquisition in complex construction scenarios. This method can be used as an important supplement to on-site sensing to further promote the automation and intelligence of the construction process.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": true, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000689894700001"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "AUG 2021", "vol": "21", "pubyear": "2021", "issue": "16", "sortdate": "2021-08-01", "pubmonth": "AUG", "pubtype": "Journal", "pubdate": "AUG 2021", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "", "page_count": "25"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 3, "WOSCC": 2}, "cc_counts": null, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "4", "content": "Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Computer Science"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "4.224", "content": "Design & Manufacturing"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "4.224.599", "content": "Project Scheduling"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "09 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {"oases": [{"open_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/16/5468/pdf?version=1628852253", "type": "gold", "is_best": true}]}, "ref_count": 115, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000689894700001", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2021", "edition": ["WOS.SCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:000689894700001", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["CCC.CCCS", "CCC.CCCT"], "coll_id": "CCC"}, {"uid": "MEDLINE:34450910", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["MEDLINE.MEDLINE"], "coll_id": "MEDLINE"}], "ut": "WOS:000689894700001"}, "13": {"doctypes": ["Review"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "2184747", "last_name": "Martinez", "wos_standard": "Martinez, P", "first_name": "Pablo"}, {"daisng_id": "28758441", "last_name": "Al-Hussein", "wos_standard": "Al-Hussein, M", "first_name": "Mohamed"}, {"daisng_id": "15010547", "last_name": "Ahmad", "wos_standard": "Ahmad, R", "first_name": "Rafiq"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "A scientometric analysis and critical review of computer vision applications for construction"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMAT CONSTR"}]}}, "docid": "594715173", "colluid": "WOS:000494887600025", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "0000000214791191"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "0926-5805"}, {"type": "eissn", "value": "1872-7891"}, {"type": "art_no", "value": "ARTN 102947"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102947"}], "doi": "10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102947", "jcrKey": "ISSN:0926-5805", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>Practical interest in 'computer vision' has risen remarkably over the last 20 years, transforming the current state of construction-related research and attracting the worldwide attention of scholars and practitioners.

The provided results were analyzed to identify the deficiencies in current research and propose future trends. Among these is a bias in the research literature towards traditional on-site construction and a concerning gap of off-site construction research, as well as a lack of inter-relationships and collaboration between researched areas, the researchers themselves, and/or the research institutions. In the near future, computer vision will play a key role in the future development of smart construction and improvement of quality in construction projects.

We survey the literature in this research area and analyse the relative importance of different sensor system modalities focusing on deep-learning-based vision and automation for the short-cycle loading task. This is a common and repetitive task that is attractive to automate. The analysis indicates that computer vision, in combination with onboard sensors, is more critical than coordinate-based positioning.

In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of human motion analysis. We divide the analysis into a modeling and an estimation phase.

To semi-automatically or automatically obtain the essential information, evaluate the ongoing activities or operations, and address project-level challenges, researchers have focused on applying various computer vision (CV)-based methods to process and interpret the acquired visual data. This research developed a framework to summarize the vision-based methods that have been applied to construction/asset management operations through a systematic literature review. The reviewed literature was composed of 103 journal papers from 2011 to 2020. All the reviewed journal papers were from the Ei Compendex database with specific search criteria. The developed framework consisted of two parts: use cases and CV domains. Use cases contained five aspects: safety monitoring, productivity improvement, progress monitoring, infrastructure inspection, and robotic application. CV domains contained six aspects: image processing, object classification, object detection, object tracking, pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction. All eleven aspects were integrated from the reviewed papers. For each reviewed paper, the general workflow of applied vision-based approaches was described and categorized into each use case. A trending timeline was developed to analyze the popularity of the identified use cases and CV domains within the reviewed time period. Both the quantity and variety of construction use cases and CV domains have increased. Challenges and limitations of applying CV-based methods in the construction industry were also identified.

In this study, we assess the level of automation achieved through various methods that enable automated computer vision (CV)-based CPM. A detailed literature review is presented, discussing the complete process of CV-based CPM based on the research conducted between 2011 and 2021. The CV-based CPM process comprises four sub-processes: data acquisition, information retrieval, progress estimation, and output visualization. Most techniques encompassing these sub-processes require human intervention to perform the desired tasks, and the inter-connectivity among them is absent. We conclude that CV-based CPM research is centric on resolving technical feasibility studies using image-based processing of site data, which are still experimental and lack connectivity to its applications for construction management.

In addition, workers have similar appearance and exhibit illumination/scale/posture variations and abrupt changes in movement over the course of their task. To address these shortcomings, we propose a vision-based method that consists of 3 models. Firstly, an adaptive model provides continuous information about the previous position of workers and their appearance features. Secondly, a prediction model is used to calculate the current position of workers, and finally, an appearance model provides accurate localisation.

The growing concern for public and workers' safety has led to a significant increase in the use of surveillance cameras that provide high-definition images and even depth maps when 3D cameras are available. Consequently, the need for automatic techniques for behavior analysis and action recognition is also increasing for several applications such as dangerous actions detection in railway stations or construction sites, event detection in crowd videos, behavior analysis, optimization in industrial sites, etc. In this context, several computer vision and deep learning solutions have been proposed recently where deep neural networks provided more accurate solutions, but they are not so efficient in terms of explainability and flexibility since they remain adapted for specific situations only. Moreover, the complexity of deep neural architectures requires the use of high computing resources to provide fast and real-time computations. In this paper, we propose a review and a comparative analysis of deep learning solutions in terms of precision, explainability, computation time, memory size, and flexibility. Experimental results are conducted within simulated and real-world dangerous actions in railway construction sites.

However, little atten-tion has been paid to understanding its evolvement path, status quo, and prospects and challenges ahead. To address the knowledge gap, this paper provides a critical review of academic research that focuses on CV-enabled MSW sorting. Prevalent CV algorithms, in particular their technical rationales and prediction performance, are introduced and compared. The distribution of academic research outputs is also examined from the aspects of waste sources, task objectives, application domains, and dataset accessibility. The review discovers a trend of shifting from traditional machine learning to deep learning algorithms. The robustness of CV for waste sorting is increasingly enhanced owing to the improved computation powers and algorithms. Academic studies were un-evenly distributed in different sectors such as household, commerce and institution, and construction. Too often, researchers reported some preliminary studies using simplified environments and artificially collected data. Future research efforts are encouraged to consider the complexities of real-world scenarios and implement CV in industrial waste sorting practice. This paper also calls for open sharing of waste image datasets for interested researchers to train and evaluate their CV algorithms.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": false, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000784292200003"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "APR 1 2022", "vol": "142", "pubyear": "2022", "sortdate": "2022-02-13", "pubmonth": "APR 1", "end": "43", "pubtype": "Journal", "begin": "29", "pubdate": "APR 1 2022", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "29-43", "page_count": "15", "early_access_date": "FEB 2022", "early_access_month": "02", "early_access_year": "2022"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 21, "WOSCC": 20}, "cc_counts": {"ALLFUNC": 4, "background": 3, "basis": 0, "support": 0, "differ": 0, "discuss": 1}, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "6", "content": "Social Sciences"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "6.115", "content": "Sustainability Science"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "6.115.1244", "content": "Municipal Solid Waste"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "12 Responsible Consumption and Production", "status": "Active"}, {"sdg_category": "11 Sustainable Cities and Communities", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {}, "ref_count": 126, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000784292200003", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2022", "edition": ["WOS.SCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:000784292200003", "entitled": "N", "year": "2022", "edition": ["CCC.CCCT"], "coll_id": "CCC"}, {"uid": "BCI:BCI202200409915", "entitled": "N", "year": "2022", "edition": ["BCI.BCI"], "coll_id": "BCI"}, {"uid": "BIOABS:BACD202200341878", "entitled": "N", "year": "2022", "edition": ["BIOABS.ABSTRACTS"], "coll_id": "BIOABS"}, {"uid": "BIOSIS:PREV202200409915", "entitled": "N", "year": "2022", "edition": ["BIOSIS.PREVIEWS"], "coll_id": "BIOSIS"}, {"uid": "INSPEC:21901657", "entitled": "N", "year": "2022", "edition": ["INSPEC.INSPEC"], "coll_id": "INSPEC"}, {"uid": "MEDLINE:35172271", "entitled": "N", "year": "2022", "edition": ["MEDLINE.MEDLINE"], "coll_id": "MEDLINE"}], "ut": "WOS:000784292200003"}, "27": {"doctypes": ["Review"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "33176210", "last_name": "Mostafa", "wos_standard": "Mostafa, K", "first_name": "Kareem"}, {"daisng_id": "39674435", "last_name": "Hegazy", "wos_standard": "Hegazy, T", "first_name": "Tarek"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "Review of image-based analysis and applications in construction"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMAT CONSTR"}]}}, "docid": "622400833", "colluid": "WOS:000606853900001", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "MOST3516210122AK"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "0926-5805"}, {"type": "eissn", "value": "1872-7891"}, {"type": "art_no", "value": "ARTN 103516"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103516"}], "doi": "10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103516", "jcrKey": "ISSN:0926-5805", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>Image-based analysis techniques offer a robust way to solve engineering problems due to the availability of visual data (e.g., surveillance cameras).

However, imagery data is not utilized effectively due to the shortage of required skillsets in the industry and nonfamiliarity with classic image processing methods. Computer vision research in the context of construction and building has heavily focused on the interface between machine learning, and object tracking and activity recognition. Although positive results have been reported, namely improved productivity, safety and quality, implementations in the industry will not be immediate. Furthermore, algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), residual neural networks (ResNet) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) usually need to undergo extensive transfer learning in order to capture projectspecific information in civil infrastructure engineering.

Using a machine to detect humans in a photo or a video frame is a very complicated and challenging task. Various techniques have been developed for this purpose, which mainly rely on Artificial Intelligence. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of the literatures from a descriptive perspective, which is its main differentiator from the existing survey papers in this area. Firstly, the vision-based human detection techniques and classifiers are elucidated in conjunction with the variants of feature extraction techniques. Secondly, various pros and cons of such techniques are discussed. Then, an investigation has been conducted and reported based on the state-of-the-art human detection descriptors (e.g. Log-Average Miss Rate and accuracy). Although techniques such as Viola-Jones and Speeded-Up Robust Features can detect objects in real-time and overcome Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) limitations, they are still sensitive to illuminated conditions. Other techniques such as SIFT, Bag of Words, Orthogonal Moments, and Histogram of oriented Gradients provide other interesting benefits which include insensitivity to occlusion and clutters, simplicity, low-order element construction and invariance to illuminated conditions; nevertheless, they are computationally expensive and sensitive to image rotation. A meticulous review along similar lines revealed that the Deformable Part-based Model performs relatively better due to its ability to deal with particular pose variations and multiple views, occlusion handling (partial) and is application-free while its counterparts focus on only a single aspect. This article highlights and provides a brief description of each available data-sets for human detection research. Various use-cases of human detection systems are also elaborated. Finally, various conclusions are derived based on the conducted review followed by recommendations for future directions and possibilities to further improve the speed and accuracy of human detection systems.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": true, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000633632000001"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "2021", "vol": "9", "pubyear": "2021", "sortdate": "2021-01-01", "end": "42761", "pubtype": "Journal", "begin": "42724", "pubdate": "2021", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "42724-42761", "page_count": "38"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 8, "WOSCC": 8}, "cc_counts": {"ALLFUNC": 5, "background": 5, "basis": 1, "support": 0, "differ": 0, "discuss": 0}, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "4", "content": "Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Computer Science"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "4.17", "content": "Computer Vision & Graphics"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "4.17.953", "content": "Object Tracking"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "11 Sustainable Cities and Communities", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {"oases": [{"open_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9312710/09366497.pdf", "type": "gold", "is_best": true}]}, "ref_count": 332, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000633632000001", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2021", "edition": ["WOS.SCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:000633632000001", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["CCC.CCCT", "CCC.CCCEC"], "coll_id": "CCC"}, {"uid": "INSPEC:20657137", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["INSPEC.INSPEC"], "coll_id": "INSPEC"}], "ut": "WOS:000633632000001"}, "35": {"doctypes": ["Review"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "35140952", "last_name": "Wang", "wos_standard": "Wang, Y", "first_name": "Yue"}, {"daisng_id": "46200207", "last_name": "Ye", "wos_standard": "Ye, T", "first_name": "Tian"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "Applications of Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Drones in Distress Pavement, Pothole Detection, and Healthcare Monitoring with Service Delivery"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "J ENG-NY"}]}}, "docid": "734523365", "colluid": "WOS:000875786300001", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "0000000382384628"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "2314-4912"}, {"type": "eissn", "value": "2314-4904"}, {"type": "art_no", "value": "ARTN 7733196"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1155/2022/7733196"}], "doi": "10.1155/2022/7733196", "jcrKey": "ISSN:2314-4912", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fascinated the present study assigned to multiple areas such as distress detection on the pavement, pothole detection, and healthcare.

The rapid growth of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has also created opportunities for improving safety management. While considerable progress has been made to improve construction safety, few studies have focused on the integration of sensor-based systems and BIM.

In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997-2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": false, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000606853900006"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "FEB 2021", "vol": "122", "pubyear": "2021", "sortdate": "2021-02-01", "pubmonth": "FEB", "pubtype": "Journal", "pubdate": "FEB 2021", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "", "page_count": "21"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 268, "WOSCC": 267}, "cc_counts": {"ALLFUNC": 82, "background": 73, "basis": 5, "support": 0, "differ": 0, "discuss": 9}, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "4", "content": "Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Computer Science"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "4.224", "content": "Design & Manufacturing"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "4.224.599", "content": "Project Scheduling"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "09 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {"highly_cited": "true"}, "category_info": {"esi_category": "Engineering"}, "ref_count": 252, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000606853900006", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2021", "edition": ["WOS.SCI", "WOS.SSCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:000606853900006", "entitled": "N", "year": "2021", "edition": ["CCC.CCCT"], "coll_id": "CCC"}], "ut": "WOS:000606853900006"}, "40": {"doctypes": ["Review"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "15565270", "last_name": "Geng", "wos_standard": "Geng, QC", "first_name": "Qichuan"}, {"daisng_id": "41382099", "last_name": "Zhou", "wos_standard": "Zhou, Z", "first_name": "Zhong"}, {"daisng_id": "5569708", "last_name": "Cao", "wos_standard": "Cao, XC", "first_name": "Xiaochun"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "Survey of recent progress in semantic image segmentation with CNNs"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "SCI CHINA INFORM SCI"}]}}, "docid": "552067983", "colluid": "WOS:000417495200014", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "0000000186261020"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "1674-733X"}, {"type": "eissn", "value": "1869-1919"}, {"type": "art_no", "value": "ARTN 051101"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1007/s11432-017-9189-6"}], "doi": "10.1007/s11432-017-9189-6", "jcrKey": "ISSN:1674-733X", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are leading the way in many computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and face recognition.

Sources of waste range from industrial waste (e.g., construction and demolition materials, hazardous wastes, ashes) to municipal solid waste (e.g., food wastes, paper, cardboard, plastics, textiles). Modern solutions do not focus only on technological aspects of waste management but also on sociological ones. Thanks to the Internet and social media platforms, scientists can influence ecological consciousness and awareness on a much larger scale. This research was conducted using the search keywords related to modern technologies for waste management.

Therefore, understanding the real differences between them is important for the correct diagnosis of dermatitis. Autoimmune blister skin diseases are uncommon skin diseases which come under heterogeneous group of disorders and happen when our immune system, which usually protects, attacks one's own skin and mucous membrane mistakenly and cause blister (bulla) formation. The diagnosis of autoimmune blistering skin diseases is based on lesions examination and requires extensive, algorithmic array of immunologic investigations that are available in a few selected centers only and are cost intensive. Thus, a computerized system is needed to diagnose the diseases without such constraints. Computer-aided systems for detection are more precise, objective and reliable as opposed to diagnosis by expert. Deep neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks, have been used for computer vision problems in several domains, have achieved the dermatologist-level accuracy in the classification of skin diseases. This paper provides the review on AIBD and its clinical features, existing tests for diagnosis, and need for early diagnosis of AIBD. Next, the techniques, challenges and shortcomings of traditional machine learning are highlighted. Then, the terminology and techniques used in the construction of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the existing use of deep neural networks, especially CNN, and transfer learning techniques for skin diseases are reviewed. Various approaches for segmentation using deep neural network are also pointed. At last, future works and conclusions about the classification of AIBD using deep learning techniques is discussed.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": false, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000961203900001"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "JUL 2023", "vol": "30", "pubyear": "2023", "issue": "6", "sortdate": "2023-03-31", "pubmonth": "JUL", "end": "3557", "pubtype": "Journal", "begin": "3529", "pubdate": "JUL 2023", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "3529-3557", "page_count": "29", "early_access_date": "MAR 2023", "early_access_month": "03", "early_access_year": "2023"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {}, "cc_counts": null, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "1", "content": "Clinical & Life Sciences"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "1.239", "content": "Tissue Barriers"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "1.239.1135", "content": "Bullous Pemphigoid"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "03 Good Health and Well-being", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {}, "ref_count": 91, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000961203900001", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2023", "edition": ["WOS.SCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:001012374300003", "entitled": "N", "year": "2023", "edition": ["CCC.CCCT"], "coll_id": "CCC"}, {"uid": "INSPEC:23680603", "entitled": "N", "year": "2023", "edition": ["INSPEC.INSPEC"], "coll_id": "INSPEC"}], "ut": "WOS:000961203900001"}, "46": {"doctypes": ["Review"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "2031925", "last_name": "Yu", "wos_standard": "Yu, YT", "first_name": "Yantao"}, {"daisng_id": "16033015", "last_name": "Umer", "wos_standard": "Umer, W", "first_name": "Waleed"}, null, {"daisng_id": "2867566", "last_name": "Antwi-Afari", "wos_standard": "Antwi-Afari, MF", "first_name": "Maxwell Fordjour"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "Posture-related data collection methods for construction workers: A review"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "AUTOMAT CONSTR"}]}}, "docid": "625548398", "colluid": "WOS:000623400400001", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "YU Y3538210124AY"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "0926-5805"}, {"type": "eissn", "value": "1872-7891"}, {"type": "art_no", "value": "ARTN 103538"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103538"}], "doi": "10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103538", "jcrKey": "ISSN:0926-5805", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>Construction workers' posture-related data is closely connected with their safety, health, and productivity performance.

There exists a longer duration such as minute-level or even hour-level in the long-term tracking task, and the task also needs to handle more frequent target disappearance and reappearance. In this paper, we provide a thorough review of long-term tracking, summarizing long-term tracking algorithms from two perspectives: framework architectures and utilization of intermediate tracking results. Then we provide a detailed description of existing benchmarks and corresponding evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments and analyse the performance of trackers on six benchmarks: VOTLT2018, VOTLT2019 (2020/2021), OxUvA, LaSOT, TLP and the long-term subset of VTUAV-V. Finally, we discuss the future prospects from multiple perspectives, including algorithm design and benchmark construction.

With the fast development of technology and the demand for environmental sustainability, it is inevitable for the building and construction industry to embrace the revolution of technology. Intelligent construction is developed in light of advanced technologies including advanced computing technology, 3D design and manufacturing, automation and control, sensing, unmanned aircraft, and autonomous intelligence. It is also closely integrated with using perceived, analytical, decision-making coordination for building construction with perceived intelligent execution technology in the processes. Currently, there is no consensus definition on \"intelligent construction\" despite its rapid development. This paper reviews existing and current development in intelligent construction focusing on the following three aspects: (a) new structural forms, which are innovative and with potential or are being applied to automated and mass manufacturing/construction; (b) automated and intelligent construction system; and (c) advanced structure sensing and monitoring technology. These three components do not compromise the entire aspects for intelligent construction, but they have no doubt are the core elements for intelligent construction towards future building systems.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": true, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000894402500001"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "NOV 2022", "vol": "12", "pubyear": "2022", "issue": "11", "sortdate": "2022-11-01", "pubmonth": "NOV", "pubtype": "Journal", "pubdate": "NOV 2022", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "", "page_count": "29"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 1, "WOSCC": 1}, "cc_counts": {"ALLFUNC": 1, "background": 1, "basis": 0, "support": 0, "differ": 0, "discuss": 0}, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "4", "content": "Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Computer Science"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "4.224", "content": "Design & Manufacturing"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "4.224.599", "content": "Project Scheduling"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "09 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {"oases": [{"open_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/12/11/1890/pdf?version=1668178889", "type": "gold", "is_best": true}]}, "ref_count": 215, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000894402500001", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2022", "edition": ["WOS.SCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:000894402500001", "entitled": "N", "year": "2022", "edition": ["CCC.CCCT"], "coll_id": "CCC"}], "ut": "WOS:000894402500001"}, "55": {"doctypes": ["Review", "Book Chapter"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "30332264", "last_name": "Studholme", "wos_standard": "Studholme, C", "first_name": "Colin"}]}, "book_editor": {"en": [{"last_name": "Yarmush", "wos_standard": "Yarmush, ML", "first_name": "ML"}, {"last_name": "Duncan", "wos_standard": "Duncan, JS", "first_name": "JS"}, {"last_name": "Gray", "wos_standard": "Gray, ML", "first_name": "ML"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "Mapping Fetal Brain Development In Utero Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: The Big Bang of Brain Mapping"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL 13"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "ANNU REV BIOMED ENG"}]}, "book_series": {"en": [{"title": "Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering"}]}}, "docid": "419350150", "colluid": "WOS:000294443000014", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "STUD0345110013AC"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "1523-9829"}, {"type": "isbn", "value": "978-0-8243-3513-7"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124654"}, {"type": "xref_doi", "value": "10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124654"}], "doi": "10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071910-124654", "jcrKey": "ISSN:1523-9829", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>The development of tools to construct and investigate probabilistic maps of the adult human brain from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to advances in both basic neuroscience and clinical diagnosis.

Based on our observations for the prevailing literature and practice, we identify that future research on safety management is needed and focused on the: (1) development of dynamic multi-modal knowledge graph; and (2) knowledge graph-based decision-making for safety.

The pipeline of traditional VSLAM methods based on classical image processing algorithms consists of six main steps, including initialization (data acquisition), feature extraction, feature matching, pose estimation, map construction, and loop closure. Since 2017, deep learning has changed this approach from individual steps to implementation as a whole. Currently, three ways are developing with varying degrees of integration of deep learning into traditional VSLAM systems: (1) adding auxiliary modules based on deep learning, (2) replacing the original modules of traditional VSLAM with deep learning modules, and (3) replacing the traditional VSLAM system with end-to-end deep neural networks. The first way is the most elaborate and includes multiple algorithms. The other two are in the early stages of development due to complex requirements and criteria.

Monitoring construction productivity is crucial for the construction project's success. Current practices for construction productivity monitoring are time-consuming, manned and error prone. Although previous studies have been implemented toward reducing these limitations, a gap still exists in the automated monitoring of construction productivity. Design/methodology/approach This study aims to investigate and assess the different techniques used for monitoring productivity in building construction projects. Therefore, a mixed review methodology (bibliometric analysis and systematic review) was adopted. All the related publications were collected from different databases, which were further screened to get the most relevant based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Findings A detailed review was performed, and it was found that traditional methods, computer vision-based and photogrammetry are the most adopted data acquisition for productivity monitoring of building projects, respectively.

This paper comprehensively and systematically reviews the state of the art in the field of extrusion-based AM, including the techniques applied and the individual challenges and developments in each materials class for which the technology is being developed.

While the collection of as-built utility locations is becoming more accurate, there still exists an important need to be capable of accurately detecting buried utilities in order to eliminate risks associated with digging. Current practices typically involve the use of trained agents to survey and detect underground utilities at locations of interest, which is a costly and time-consuming process. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI), an opportunity arose in conducting virtual sensing of buried utilities by combining robotics (e.g., drones), knowledge, and logic. This paper reviewed methods that are based on AI in mapping underground infrastructure. In particular, the use of AI in aerial and terrestrial mapping of utility assets was reviewed, followed by a summary of AI techniques used in fusing multi-source data in creating underground infrastructure maps. Key observations from the consolidated literature were that (1) when leveraging computer vision methods, automatic mapping techniques vastly focus on manholes localized from aerial imagery; (2) when applied to non-intrusive sensing, AI methods vastly focus on empowering ground-penetrating radar (GPR)-produced data; and (3) data fusion techniques to produce utility maps should be extended to any utility assets/types.

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no extensive survey of the applications of deep learning techniques within the construction industry. This review would inspire future research into how best to apply image processing, computer vision, natural language processing techniques of deep learning to numerous challenges in the industry.

For a long time, CPM has been significantly researched with increasing enthusiasm. Although a few review studies have been carried out, there is non-existence of a quantitative review study that can deliver a holistic picture of CPM. Design/methodology/approach The science mapping-based scientometric analysis was systematically processed with 1,835 CPM-related journal articles retrieved from Scopus. The co-authorship analysis and direct citation analysis were carried out to identify the most influential researchers, countries and publishers of the knowledge domain. The co-occurrence analysis of keyword was assessed to reveal the most dominating research topics and research trend with the visual representation of the considered research domain. Findings This study reveals seven clusters of main research topics from the keyword co-occurrence analysis. The evolution of research confirms that CPM-related research studies were mainly focused on fundamental and traditional CPM research topics before 2007. The period between 2007 and 2020 has seen a shift of research efforts towards digitalization and automation. The result suggests Building Information Modelling (BIM) as the most common, growing and influential research topic in the CPM research domain. It has been used in combination with different data acquisition technologies (e.g. photogrammetry, videogrammetry, laser scanning, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors) and data analytics approaches (e.g. machine learning and computer vision). Practical implications This study provides the horizon of potential research in the research domain of CPM to researchers, policymakers and practitioners by availing of main research themes, current knowledge gaps and future research directions.

In remote sensing image analysis, the images captured through satellite and drones are used to observe surface of the Earth. The main aim of any image classification-based system is to assign semantic labels to captured images, and consequently, using these labels, images can be arranged in a semantic order. The semantic arrangement of images is used in various domains of digital image processing and computer vision such as remote sensing, image retrieval, object recognition, image annotation, scene analysis, content-based image analysis, and video analysis. The earlier approaches for remote sensing image analysis are based on low-level and mid-level feature extraction and representation. These techniques have shown good performance by using different feature combinations and machine learning approaches. These earlier approaches have used small-scale image dataset. The recent trends for remote sensing image analysis are shifted to the use of deep learning model. Various hybrid approaches of deep learning have shown much better results than the use of a single deep learning model. In this review article, a detailed overview of the past trends is presented, based on low-level and mid-level feature representation using traditional machine learning concepts. A summary of publicly available image benchmarks for remote sensing image analysis is also presented. A detailed summary is presented at the end of each section. An overview regarding the current trends of deep learning models is presented along with a detailed comparison of various hybrid approaches based on recent trends.

Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful tool to assist in addressing these problems. Therefore, over the years, researchers have been conducting research on AI in the AEC industry (Al-in-the-AECI). In this paper, the first comprehensive scientometric study appraising the state-of-the-art of research on Al-in-the-AECI is presented. The science mapping method was used to systematically and quantitatively analyze 41,827 related bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus. The results indicated that genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, and machine learning have been the most widely used AI methods in AEC. Optimization, simulation, uncertainty, project management, and bridges have been the most commonly addressed topics/issues using AI methods/concepts. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lies in it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of the literature on Al-in-the-AECI. This study adds value to the AEC literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns, identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on Al-in-the-AECI. The findings bring to light the deficiencies in the current research and provide paths for future research, where they indicated that future research opportunities lie in applying robotic automation and convolutional neural networks to AEC problems. For the world of practice, the study offers a readily-available point of reference for practitioners, policy makers, and research and development (R&D) bodies. This study therefore raises the level of awareness of AI and facilitates building the intellectual wealth of the AI area in the AEC industry.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": true, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000526785600005"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "APR 2020", "vol": "112", "pubyear": "2020", "sortdate": "2020-04-01", "pubmonth": "APR", "pubtype": "Journal", "pubdate": "APR 2020", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "", "page_count": "19"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 205, "WOSCC": 203}, "cc_counts": {"ALLFUNC": 37, "background": 28, "basis": 3, "support": 0, "differ": 0, "discuss": 11}, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "4", "content": "Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Computer Science"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "4.224", "content": "Design & Manufacturing"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "4.224.599", "content": "Project Scheduling"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "09 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {"oases": [{"open_url": "http://ira.lib.polyu.edu.hk/bitstream/10397/88256/1/Darko_Artificial_Intelligence_AEC.pdf", "type": "green_accepted", "is_best": true}], "highly_cited": "true"}, "category_info": {"esi_category": "Engineering"}, "ref_count": 115, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000526785600005", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2020", "edition": ["WOS.SCI", "WOS.SSCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}, {"uid": "CCC:000526785600005", "entitled": "N", "year": "2020", "edition": ["CCC.CCCT"], "coll_id": "CCC"}], "ut": "WOS:000526785600005"}, "71": {"doctypes": ["Review", "Early Access"], "names": {"author": {"en": [{"daisng_id": "16112043", "last_name": "Jafary", "wos_standard": "Jafary, P", "first_name": "Peyman"}, {"daisng_id": "2091693", "last_name": "Shojaei", "wos_standard": "Shojaei, D", "first_name": "Davood"}, null, {"daisng_id": "30005725", "last_name": "Ngo", "wos_standard": "Ngo, T", "first_name": "Tuan"}]}}, "titles": {"item": {"en": [{"title": "BIM and real estate valuation: challenges, potentials and lessons for future directions"}]}, "source": {"en": [{"title": "ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT"}]}, "source_abbrev": {"en": [{"title": "ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MA"}]}}, "docid": "743070615", "colluid": "WOS:000894423400001", "identifiers": [{"type": "ckey", "value": "0000000390105243"}, {"type": "issn", "value": "0969-9988"}, {"type": "eissn", "value": "1365-232X"}, {"type": "doi", "value": "10.1108/ECAM-07-2022-0642"}], "doi": "10.1108/ECAM-07-2022-0642", "jcrKey": "ISSN:0969-9988", "coll": "WOS", "abstract": {"basic": {"en": {"abstract": "<p>Purpose - Building information modeling (BIM) is a striking development in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, which provides in-depth information on different stages of the building lifecycle. Real estate valuation, as a fully interconnected field with the AEC industry, can benefit from 3D technical achievements in BIM technologies. Some studies have attempted to use BIM for real estate valuation procedures. However, there is still a limited understanding of appropriate mechanisms to utilize BIM for valuation purposes and the consequent impact that BIM can have on decreasing the existing uncertainties in the valuation methods. Therefore, the paper aims to analyze the literature on BIM for real estate valuation practices. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a systematic review to analyze existing utilizations of BIM for real estate valuation practices, discovers the challenges, limitations and gaps of the current applications and presents potential domains for future investigations. Research was conducted on the Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar databases to find relevant references that could contribute to the study. A total of 52 publications including journal papers, conference papers and proceedings, book chapters and PhD and master's theses were identified and thoroughly reviewed. There was no limitation on the starting date of research, but the end date was May 2022. Findings - Four domains of application have been identified: (1) developing machine learning-based valuation models using the variables that could directly be captured through BIM and industry foundation classes (IFC) data instances of building objects and their attributes; (2) evaluating the capacity of 3D factors extractable from BIM and 3D GIS in increasing the accuracy of existing valuation models; (3) employing BIM for accurate estimation of components of cost approach-based valuation practices; and (4) extraction of useful visual features for real estate valuation from BIM representations instead of 2D images through deep learning and computer vision. Originality/value - This paper contributes to research efforts on utilization of 3D modeling in real estate valuation practices. In this regard, this paper presents a broad overview of the current applications of BIM for valuation procedures and provides potential ways forward for future investigations.</p>"}}}, "reference": false, "oa": false, "id": {"type": "colluid", "value": "WOS:000894423400001"}, "pub_info": {"coverdate": "", "pubyear": "2022", "sortdate": "2022-12-07", "pubmonth": "DEC 7", "pubtype": "Journal", "pubdate": "", "has_abstract": "Y", "page_no": "", "page_count": "36", "early_access_date": "DEC 2022", "early_access_month": "12", "early_access_year": "2022"}, "citation_related": {"counts": {"ALLDB": 1, "WOSCC": 1}, "cc_counts": null, "citation_topics": [{"content-type": "macro", "content-id": "6", "content": "Social Sciences"}, {"content-type": "meso", "content-id": "6.86", "content": "Human Geography"}, {"content-type": "micro", "content-id": "6.86.789", "content": "House Prices"}], "SDG": [{"sdg_category": "11 Sustainable Cities and Communities", "status": "Active"}]}, "associated_data": false, "chem_indicator": false, "ic_related": {}, "ref_count": 201, "clustered_EWUIDs": [{"uid": "WOS:000894423400001", "entitled": "Y", "year": "2022", "edition": ["WOS.SCI", "WOS.SSCI"], "coll_id": "WOS"}], "ut": "WOS:000894423400001"}}
