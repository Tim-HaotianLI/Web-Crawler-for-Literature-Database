Previous efforts have concentrated on wearable sensors or computer vision-based monitoring. However, certain limitations need to be further investigated. First, wearable sensor-based studies lack reliability due to vulnerability to environmental interferences. Second, conventional computer vision-based recognition demonstrates classification inaccuracy under adverse environmental conditions, such as insufficient illumination and occlusion. To address the above limitations, this study presents an innovative and automated approach for recognizing and classifying awkward working postures. This approach leverages multimodal data collected from various sensors and apparatuses, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of different modalities. A feature-level fusion strategy is employed to train deep learning-based networks, including a multilayer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Among these networks, the LSTM model achieves optimal performance, with an impressive accuracy of 99.6% and an F1-score of 99.7%. A comparison of metrics between single-modality and multimodal-fused training methods demonstrates that the incorporation of multimodal fusion significantly enhances the classification performance. Furthermore, the study examines the performance of the LSTM network under adverse environmental conditions. The accuracy of the model remains consistently above 90% in such conditions, indicating that the model\u2019s generalizability is enhanced through the multimodal fusion strategy. In conclusion, this study mainly contributes to the body of knowledge on proactive prevention for safety and health risks in the construction industry by offering an automated approach with excellent adaptability in adverse conditions.

However, ordered photo collection requires a strict capture plan and happens only after a specific time interval. Additionally, the reality models demand a considerable amount of processing time.

However, a review of available literature suggests that most of the existing vision-based inspection techniques rely only on color information, due to the immediate availability of inexpensive high-resolution cameras. Regular cameras translate a 3D scene to a 2D space, which leads to a loss of information vis-\u00e0-vis distance and scale. This imposes a barrier to the realization of the full potential of vision-based techniques. In this regard, the structural health monitoring community is yet to benefit from the new opportunities that commercially-available low-cost depth sensors offer. This study aims at filling this knowledge gap by incorporating depth fusion into an encoder-decoder-based semantic segmentation model. Advanced computer graphics approaches are exploited to generate a database of paired RGB and depth images representing various damage categories that are commonly observed in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, namely, spalling, spalling with exposed rebars, and severely buckled rebars. A number of encoding techniques are explored for representing the depth data. Additionally, various schemes for the data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusions of RGB and depth data are investigated to identify the best fusion strategy. Overall, it was observed that feature-level fusion is the most effective and can enhance the performance of deep learning-based damage segmentation algorithms by up to 25% without any appreciable increase in the computation time.

Although traditional deep learning vision-based methods have proven their effectiveness in construction site monitoring, a shortage of realistic training images and inefficiencies in them have been an obstacle in achieving effective tower crane monitoring. To deal with this issue, this paper presents a database-free approach for timely productivity monitoring of tower crane operations. Using a synthetic model, the authors construct a research framework to effectively generate training images on deep learning\u2013powered object detection. Additionally, an enhanced tracking algorithm collaborating with unsupervised clustering-driven postprocessing enables stable performance for tracking resources. Further, logical ontology-based activity recognition constructed on domain-specific knowledge takes place to estimate time-to-time operation of the tower crane. The curtainwall installation was selected to represent the dynamicity and variability of tower crane operations for which it has been difficult to apply traditional deep learning technologies. Results displayed that the intended framework successfully produced 300,000 training images in 1\u00a0h, about 500 times faster than human resources, and an enhanced tracker performed well even in the case of unsatisfactory detection results. It is also proved that a performance of activity analysis was acceptable to 93.58% accuracy.

Slag-modified soil (SMS), which is commonly used as a reinforcing material for construction in highway and railway engineering, has special mechanical and microstructural characteristics that are easily altered under external disturbances. Although the macroscopic deformation of SMS has been widely examined, research on its cracking behavior at the mesoscale under an external load has received insufficient attention thus far. This study uses real-time X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) as a nondestructive tool for characterizing the microstructure of a SMS specimen subjected to uniaxial compression. Rules for the dynamic propagation of cracks in the specimen during deformation are identified based on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) visualization and quantitative characterization. The results showed that the SMS can be divided into three components\u2014cracks, soil, and steel slag\u2014based on the density gradients from X-ray CT images. The preprocessed X-ray CT images and reconstructed crack models dynamically demonstrated the expanding and connecting patterns of internal cracks during the entire process of deformation. Values of the crack ratio and the degree of connectivity were positively correlated with the axial strain as expressed by a cubic spline function and a linear function, respectively. Curves of the distribution of the volumes of the cracks suggest that cracks in SMS can be divided into four groups: minicracks, mesocracks, medium cracks, and macroscopic cracks. From quantitative and visual perspectives, a large number of original cracks with small volume and low connectivity were gradually transformed into a main fracture under uniaxial loading. The localized shear band, which existed in the zone adjacent to the main fracture, was generated and obliquely distributed in an irregular, flat strip shape in the middle of the SMS specimen.

Therefore, special considerations should be taken to mitigate communication errors that could occur between the two parties. Technology can play an important role in enhancing communication, and, with recent advancements in technology, human\u2013computer interaction has emerged as an active area of research within the field of computer vision. This paper presents a framework that integrates the YOLOv4 model (for object detection) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) model (a recurrent neural network) for dynamic hand signal classification in real time. The first step is the creation of a crane signalman dynamic hand signal data set with 18 classes. The YOLOv4 model is then customized for this application by modifying the activation function. Three modified YOLOv4 models are then integrated with the LSTM model. The modified YOLOv4 integrated with LSTM is found to achieve a maximum overall accuracy of 94.8% with an inference time of 55.1 frames per second. The model is further validated with real-time dynamic hand signal classification, achieving an accuracy of 93.5% and an inference time of 44 frames per second. The proposed models show improved quality in classification accuracy as well as in processing speed in comparison to some of the most widely used models currently in use.

The joint design was165 mm (6.5 in.) wide and filled with shrinkage-compensating concrete and reinforced with transverse steel bars. Although the previous laboratory test and analytical simulation results indicated that the joint showed superior performance when resisting the joint early-age cracking and maintained the integrity of the bridge superstructure, its performance on a real onsite bridge was not evaluated. This paper documented the field evaluation of this new design on a single span box beam bridge. A bridge in Washington County, Iowa was selected to deploy the joint. To evaluate the performance of this first implementation, a 7-day field monitoring campaign was conducted during the early-age of the joint material. In addition, a live load field test and two bridge inspections at 6-month intervals were performed. During the field tests and monitoring work, temperature, strain, and displacement data were collected at critical locations and analyzed to evaluate the joint functionality on cracking resistance and load distribution. The visual inspections were conducted and focused on the condition and performance of the joint with a specific interest in the development of any cracking. The results indicated that this new joint was well suited to resist early-age joint longitudinal cracking, which is common in other joint designs. The joint was efficient in load distribution and the bridge superstructure behaved as an integral structure when the live load was placed. In addition, with an integral abutment, the construction of the abutment affected the strain distribution in the joint near the joint ends. This effect tended to provide compression in the transverse direction and reduced the potential of joint cracking.", "keywords": ["Adjacent box girder bridge", "Box beam connection", "Early-age concrete performance", "Field testing", "Type K cement", "Bridge tests", "Continuum mechanics", "Cracking", "Design (by type)", "Engineering fundamentals", "Engineering mechanics", "Field tests", "Fracture mechanics", "Joints", "Laboratory tests", "Live loads", "Load distribution", "Load tests", "Solid mechanics", "Static loads", "Statics (mechanics)", "Structural design", "Structural engineering", "Structural members", "Structural systems", "Tests (by type)"]}, "35": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29MT.1943-5533.0004559", "journal": "Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering", "title": "Image Processing of Aggregate Skeleton Structure of Asphalt Mixture for Aggregate Uniformity Quantification", "pubyear": "2022", "abstract": "Nonuniform or segregated asphalt mixture has been critical in asphalt pavement construction, accelerating pavement damage and reducing pavement service life.

A total of 1,188 images were first collected from a new construction site and then preprocessed to identify the coarse aggregate. The aggregate particle and skeleton structure factors were obtained, including particle quantity and position distribution, particle axial length ratio, particle orientation, and distance between particles. We used the entropy weight method to combine these four factors to propose a uniformity quantification index (UQI).

The results show that the uniformity level ranked by the UQI was more consistent with the visual observation than the other two indices. Among the four factors, the particle quantity and position distribution, particle axial length ratio, and distance between particles correlate well with the asphalt mixture uniformity.

Human intrusion into static hazardous areas is a significant cause of accidents. Traditional engineering safety management mainly relies on manual methods, such as patrol inspection by safety supervisors, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and it is difficult to achieve a complete safety supervision. In recent years, the emergence of artificial intelligence technology and computer vision has provided a new scheme for intrusion detection. However, existing studies have used a single method for human intrusion judgment in static dangerous areas, without in-depth consideration of the influence of human posture, intrusion direction, and other factors. In this study, a computer vision\u2013based intrusion detection method was developed, mainly aimed at static hazardous areas. The object detection was based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) V5 module to extract the image feature information. Subsequently, the basic rule of intrusion judgment based on the key points of bounding boxes was formulated, in which the workers\u2019 intrusion direction was recognized and postured using two auxiliary detection modules. Finally, the intrusion rule base was constructed as the basis for human intrusion detection, containing rules with different sensitivities for different intrusion states.

The revolving mechanical arm of excavators poses a major risk of contact-driven accidents for workers in its proximity due to its articulated pose. Detecting the 3D pose of excavator arms is thus essential to prevent contact-driven accidents near excavators. Previous works have attempted to estimate 3D excavator poses using sensor-based or computer vision-based methods. However, existing methods require extensive preparation work, such as attaching physical sensors, calibrating stereo cameras, or collecting 3D training data. As a result, existing methods cannot be easily integrated into the current construction workflow and are seldom applied in real-world situations. The authors propose a projection-based 3D pose optimization method that utilizes excavator kinematic constraints to infer 3D excavator poses from monocular image sequences with no dependency on 3D training data. The proposed method first extracts the 2D excavator pose from images using a keypoint region-based convolution neural network. Then, the 2D pose is reconstructed into 3D by enforcing the rigid excavator kinematic constraints (e.g.,\u00a0arm length) and minimizing the 2D reprojection error of the excavator pose. Tests using a 1:14 miniature excavator model showed a 3D position error of 7.3\u00a0cm (or 1.03\u00a0m when scaled up to real-world dimensions) for keypoints on the excavator pose, demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed method in estimating 3D excavator poses from monocular images. The proximity measuring capacity of the estimated 3D pose was also evaluated, achieving a mean absolute distance error of 4.7\u00a0cm (or 0.66\u00a0m scaled). The proposed method offers a 3D excavator pose estimation method using only a monocular camera and without relying on 3D training data. The estimated 3D excavator pose enables safety managers to monitor potential contact-driven accidents near excavators and alert workers of unsafe situations and promotes safer working environments for construction workers near excavators.", "keywords": ["Excavator", "Contact-driven accident", "Proximity monitoring", "Construction safety", "Three dimensional (3D) pose estimation", "Kinematic constraints", "Computer vision", "Business management", "Construction engineering", "Construction management", "Construction methods", "Continuum mechanics", "Dynamics (solid mechanics)", "Education", "Engineering fundamentals", "Engineering mechanics", "Errors (statistics)", "Excavation", "Kinematics", "Kinetics", "Mathematics", "Models (by type)", "Occupational safety", "Practice and Profession", "Project management", "Public administration", "Public health and safety", "Safety", "Solid mechanics", "Statistics", "Three-dimensional models", "Training"]}, "39": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CP.1943-5487.0001051", "journal": "Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering", "title": "BIM-Enabled Infrastructure Asset Management Using Information Containers and Semantic Web", "pubyear": "2022", "abstract": "The paper proposes a solution for a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-enabled Infrastructure Asset Management System (AMS) for road owners.

Computer vision (CV) techniques provide powerful tools for image processing and high-level scene analysis. Despite the complexities associated with water in visual scenes, there are still some physical differences, such as color, turbidity, and turbulence, affected by surrounding settings, which can potentially support CV modeling to cope with the visual processing challenges of water.

In addition, the use of synthetic images has an additional benefit that training images can be easily customized for a target construction site by considering the context of the site (e.g.,\u00a0different background scenes, camera positions, and angles) and the possible variability of target objects to be detected (e.g.,\u00a0different sizes, locations, rotation angles, and postures) on images. An automated approach proposed in this study attempts to systematically create the synthetic images using the Unity game engine in which context- and variability-related parameters can be controlled. The proposed method was validated by training a deep learning-based object detection algorithm [i.e.,\u00a0a faster regions with convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model] with synthetic images and testing it on real images from earthwork construction sites to detect an excavator. The CNN models trained with synthetic images showed an average precision value of more than 90%; in particular, the classifier using synthetic images outperformed the one using real site images. The detection results also demonstrated an improved capability to capture the high irregularity of a construction object on images when using techniques of context customization and variability randomization.

As workers focus most of their attention on their own tasks, their ability to detect changes in the surrounding environment is reduced, and it is difficult to avoid the collision risk of heavy falling objects. To solve this problem, this study establishes a dynamic collision prewarning mechanism for tower crane construction based on vision and trajectory analysis by tracking and predicting the trajectories of loads and workers. Specifically, the proposed dynamic collision prewarning mechanism consists of three parts. First, Fairmultiple object tracking (FairMOT), a multiple object tracking algorithm based on deep learning, is used to detect and track workers and loads, and time-series data of their positions are obtained. Then a trajectory prediction model based on a transformer is applied to predict the trajectories of objects in the future (10\u00a0s) based on the historical data. Finally, safety rules are established by considering the locations, speeds, shapes, and sizes of loads and workers and their trajectories over a period of time. Risk levels for each worker are assigned to reduce the risk of collisions between workers and loads. Finally, the performance of the models is evaluated at a construction site. FairMOT has good tracking performance and can continuously track objects with short occlusion (2\u00a0s). Transformer-based trajectory prediction model has higher accuracy than other methods [e.g.,\u00a0social generative adversarial network (GAN), social long short-term memory (LSTM)]. The results of the study show that the proposed method can accurately predict the unsafe approach of workers and loads.

Stream power, or the rate of energy expenditure of flowing water, is a driver of river erosion and morphologic change. Stream Power Index for Networks (SPIN) is a newly developed geographic information system (GIS)-based toolbox that uses simple inputs to calculate total stream power, specific stream power, and their change between past, present, and future land-use conditions. We tested the ability of SPIN to identify areas of erosion risk by comparing its outputs against an independent database of erosion mitigation sites in an urban river. Objectives were to (1)\u00a0validate the channel slope and threshold particle size calculated by the toolbox against data collected from field sites, (2)\u00a0assess the utility of the toolbox outputs for interpreting spatial patterns of erosion control structure construction and maintenance, and (3)\u00a0evaluate how the toolbox can be used to support or enhance current erosion monitoring techniques. Channel slope and threshold substrate size values calculated by SPIN matched those measured in the watershed. Both total and specific stream power increased between the rural (preurban) and urban land-use conditions, and maps generated by the toolbox provided a visual assessment of areas of expected erosion risk. The density of erosion control structures increased with total and specific stream power, and threshold stream power ratio values were identified above which erosion control structures were widespread. Stream power indices were also related to the condition of erosion control structures when defined as the distance between the channel erosion and the infrastructure. The SPIN toolbox makes a novel contribution to erosion hazard assessment at a watershed scale.

The recent growth of visual data captured actively on construction sites has opened a new opportunity to increase the frequency of worker safety monitoring. This paper shows that a comprehensive vision-based assessment is the most informative to automatically infer worker severity level from images. Efficient computer vision models are presented to conduct this risk analysis. The method is validated on a challenging image dataset first of its kind. Specifically, the proposed method detects and evaluates the worker state from visual data, defined by (1)\u00a0worker body posture, (2)\u00a0the usage of personal protective equipment, (3)\u00a0worker interactions with tools and materials, (4)\u00a0the construction activity being performed, and (5)\u00a0the presence of surrounding workplace hazards. To estimate the worker state, a multitasked recognition model is introduced that recognizes objects, activity, and keypoints from visual data simultaneously, taking 36.6% less time and 40.1% less memory while keeping comparably performances compared to a system running individual models for each subtask. Worker activity recognition is further improved with a spatio-temporal graph neural network model using recognized per-frame worker activity, detected bounding boxes of tools and materials, and estimated worker poses. Finally, severity levels are predicted by a trained classifier on a dataset of images of construction workers accompanied with ground truth severity level annotations. In the test dataset assembled from real-world projects, the severity level prediction model achieves 85.7% cross-validation accuracy in a bricklaying task and 86.6% cross-validation accuracy for a plastering task, demonstrating the potential for near real-time worker safety detection and severity assessment.", "keywords": []}, "66": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CP.1943-5487.0000975", "journal": "Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering", "title": "Reidentification-Based Automated Matching for 3D Localization of Workers in Construction Sites", "pubyear": "2021", "abstract": "The location information of entities in construction sites, such as workers and construction machines, is valuable in project management and safety. Therefore, as nonintrusive and accurate solutions, various vision-based methods have been proposed to track entities in construction sites and obtain their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates. However, most existing vision-based methods realize 3D localizations by basing entity matching on the epipolar line, which brings instability in entity matching due to the calculation error of the epipolar line or failure to match entities when multiple entities are located on the same epipolar. To solve this problem, a novel framework based on reidentification is proposed to automatically match workers across two camera views, thereby obtaining their 3D coordinates in construction sites. In this framework, deep-learning-based computer vision algorithms are firstly used to detect and track workers in two camera views. Then, the reidentification (ReID) algorithm is applied to utilize tracked workers\u2019 visual features to match the workers across both two camera views and different frames. As a result, for every matched pair, the worker\u2019s pixel locations in two camera views can be obtained to calculate the 3D coordinates through triangulation. The implementation of videos recorded from a real construction project proves the feasibility and accuracy of this framework. Specifically, through utilizing the ReID algorithm to match workers, the framework achieves competitive results on workers matching with precision, recall, and accuracy of more than 99%, 93%, and 93%. Furthermore, it also effectively addresses the practical problems of ID repetition and ID switching.

However, earthmoving operations are restricted to site work and surrounding terrain, and the presence of other structures, particularly in urban areas, limits the number of viewpoints from which operations can be recorded. These considerations lower the degree of intra-activity and interactivity category variability to which said algorithms are exposed, hindering their potential for generalizing effectively to new jobsites. Secondly, training computer vision algorithms is also typically reliant on large quantities of hand-annotated ground truth.

A novel framework is introduced to predict the sawcut initiation time (ts) by integrating a one-sided noncontact, ultrasonic testing system (UTS) to estimate the concrete\u2019s final setting time (tf), and a computer vision (CV) algorithm to determine an acceptable level of joint raveling. Six distinct concrete mixtures were cast into slab specimens (500\u00d7500\u00d7150\u2009\u2009mm3) in the laboratory.

To improve the efficacy of fatigue crack inspections, previous research has proposed and examined numerous fatigue crack detection approaches, including both user-implemented technology and structural health monitoring methods. However, these approaches typically require human presence and active participation at the location of interest or prolonged mechanical contact and continuous monitoring of the structure. This limits the effectiveness and flexibility of these approaches for inspecting a large number of fatigue-susceptible regions found on steel bridges. Recently, vision-based sensing technologies have been explored for applications related to damage detection and health assessment in civil infrastructure, as they offer the benefits of being low cost, noncontact, and deployable without human presence at the specific region of interest. This paper presents a digital image correlation-based methodology developed from in-plane compact fracture specimens for the detection and quantification of fatigue cracks. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is further evaluated through experimental tests of a fatigue crack on a large-scale steel girder-to-cross-frame connection, similar to the out-of-plane fatigue cracks commonly found on steel highway bridges.

Proactive safety measures such as safety perception and safety detection capability of employees play an important role in improving the safety performance. This study was initiated by three research questions related to (1)\u00a0the measurement indicators of employees\u2019 cognitive load in recognizing safety hazards; (2)\u00a0site condition factors (e.g.,\u00a0brightness) that can affect subjects\u2019 cognitive load; and (3)\u00a0the quantification of the effects of these site factors on cognitive load. An eye-tracking experimental approach was adopted by recruiting a total of 55 students from construction management or other civil engineering disciplines to visually search hazards in 20 given site scenes. These site scenes were defined by a combination of three different categories, namely distinctiveness of hazards, site brightness, and tidiness. Quantitative measurements of experimental participants\u2019 visual search patterns were obtained from data captured by the eye-tracking apparatus. Based on metrics related to experimental participants\u2019 fixation, visual search track, and attention map, these measurements were computed to evaluate participants\u2019 cognitive load in detecting hazards. Descriptive statistical comparisons analyzed these metrics under predefined categories of site conditions, i.e.,\u00a0distinctness versus obscurity/blurriness, brightness versus darkness, and tidiness versus messiness. The findings revealed that distinct site conditions reduced participants\u2019 time in saccades to search hazards but did not improve the accuracy rate of first fixation; messy sites with disorganized items increased participants\u2019 cognitive load in detecting hazards in terms of all five measurement items (i.e.,\u00a0accuracy rate of first fixation, fixation count, intersection coefficient, fixation duration, and fixation count in the attention center); the effect of increased brightness on-site needs further studies to determine the optimal balance of brightness level and allocation. Recommendations based on the findings were provided to enhance safety education in terms of site hazard distinctiveness, brightness, and housekeeping best practice. This study extended a few prior studies of adopting eye-tracking technology for safety monitoring by evaluating the impacts of site conditions on participants\u2019 cognitive load, which was linked to their hazard detection performance.

Most existing studies use either a vision-based or radio-based approach to automatically track construction entities, which, however, are bounded by the limitations of the applied technology. Vision-based tracking can achieve high localization accuracy but suffers from identity (ID) switch and fragmentation errors when multiple workers are in close proximity or occluded. In contrast, radio-based tracking is reliable in object detection and identification but less accurate in localization. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses results obtained from vision-based tracking and radio-based identification and localization for the 3D tracking of multiple construction workers. Compared to traditional fusion approaches that directly fuse locations extracted from these two approaches, the proposed method treats vision-based tracking as the main source to extract the object trajectory. Radio-based identification and localization results are used as a supplementary source to augment anonymous visual tracks with identity information and correct errors (e.g.,\u00a0false positives) in vision-based object detection, resulting in ID-linked 3D trajectories. In addition, a searching algorithm is introduced to recover possible missed detections in one camera view from the corresponding observations in the other view by applying a sliding window to search for regions with the most similar appearance along epipolar line. The newly created method has been validated using two indoor experiments. The results show that the new approach for fusing vision- and radio-based results increases the overall accuracy from 88% and 87% to 95% and 90%, compared to using a vision-based approach alone.

The existing management method for detecting workers\u2019 unsafe behaviors and unsafe states of objects relies primarily on manual monitoring, which does not only consume large amounts of time and money but also cannot cover all workers in the entire construction site. Meanwhile, the workers\u2019 perception of being at risk of injury decreases when they are concentrated in a crowded and noisy environment. In this case, it is difficult for them to take essential measures to protect themselves in the face of danger. In view of the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a method of evaluating the collision safety level of construction workers based on computer vision and fuzzy inference. Specifically, the proposed model works via two modules: vision extraction and safety assessment. The vision extraction module identifies construction workers and equipment through computer vision; centroid pixel coordinates and crowdedness are then extracted from a detection box. Afterward, the spatial relationship between moving devices and workers is calculated by a pixel calibration process. In the safety assessment module, the collected status information is analyzed by evaluating the safety level of each worker and conducting accident prevention through a fuzzy inference system. The safety level, which indicates the comprehensive risk of collision between workers and equipment in a particular dynamic environment, will be displayed numerically, breaking through the limitations of conventional qualitative evaluation. Field experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed method of informing workers about potential danger situations in an objective way. Moreover, by setting a safety-level threshold, the onsite safety management personnel can take corresponding measures to avoid collision accidents when the worker\u2019s safety level is lower than the threshold.", "keywords": ["Safety management", "Collision accident", "Construction worker", "Computer vision", "Fuzzy inference"]}, "106": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CO.1943-7862.0001828", "journal": "Journal of Construction Engineering and Management", "title": "Exploring the Potential of Technological Innovations for Temporary Structures: A Survey Study", "pubyear": "2020", "abstract": "Technology innovations, such as virtual design and construction (VDC) tools, light detection and ranging (lidar), global positioning system (GPS), and other vision-based or sensor-based systems, provide approaches that designers, builders, and other stakeholders can adopt to address, manage, and tackle design, planning, and site safety issues effectively during the design and construction phases. Nevertheless, the majority of technology applications have focused on permanent structures rather than temporary structures such as concrete formwork and scaffolding. Due to the temporary nature of temporary structures, stakeholders might easily underestimate their importance and pay less attention to their safety, quality, and performance.

Effective and efficient disaster response and recovery require reliable situational awareness regarding infrastructure disruptions and their societal impacts. Due to the rapid unfolding and evolution of events in disasters and emergencies, typical data sensing techniques (such as remote sensing and satellite images) are not sufficient to gain reliable situational awareness about disruptions that affect communities at a local scale. Social sensing enables gathering and analyzing massive user-generated data from various sources (social media, in particular) to monitor unfolding of localized events such as infrastructure disruptions and community needs. To advance social sensing methods and their integration into digital twins of cities, this study proposes an integrated framework for detecting infrastructure disruptions based on three information elements embedded in social media content: images, texts, and geo-maps. The framework consists of three main methods: a graph-based approach for detecting critical tweets, an image-ranking algorithm for selecting important images, and a kernel density estimate for estimating the geographical scales of the disruptions. The application of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study of water release from flood control reservoirs in Houston during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The findings illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework for capturing the critical situational information and interpreting the results for situational awareness and disruption response.

The current state of research for automated cycle time prediction for construction operations is based on processing kinematic data (e.g.,\u00a0acceleration) or implementing computer vision algorithms. Both methods have certain limitations (e.g.,\u00a0it is necessary to directly attach kinematic sensors to machines, and computer vision algorithms are very sensitive to lighting conditions and occlusions).

Previous research has shown that individual characteristics such as past injury exposure contribute greatly to skill-based (e.g.,\u00a0attention failure) and perception-based (e.g.,\u00a0failure to identify and misperception) errors and subsequent accident involvement. However, a dearth of research empirically examined how a worker\u2019s personality affects his or her attention and hazard identification. This study addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the impacts of the personality dimensions on the selective attention of workers exposed to fall hazards.

In addition, this study identified and analyzed various actions such as decision making, problem solving, and design alternatives that occur as users interact with AR on different mobile computers.

An automatic computer vision-based technique could be a novel solution for crowdedness monitoring for proactive safety management. Non-intrusiveness and applicability in a complex outdoor environment are critical considerations for device selection on construction sites. Accordingly, a red, green, and blue (RGB) camera is selected to detect worker-centric crowdedness. This device is less intrusive for workers than wearable sensors and is also widely applied in outdoor construction sites considering complex working areas and various light conditions. Previous RGB camera-based methods for crowdedness detection simplify the proximity estimation process by assuming that the construction site is a two-dimensional (2D) planar surface. These methods use image pixels for proximity calculation. Such simplification can cause a distortion in three-dimensional (3D) spatial proximity due to 2D projection of 3D entities.

To improve visibility, heavy-equipment manufacturers have adopted a system that monitors an all-around view of the area surrounding the equipment via cameras installed on every side (i.e.,\u00a0front, right, left, and rear) of the equipment body to display the surrounding environment on the operator\u2019s monitor. Although these systems improve the visibility of the surrounding environment, detecting potential collisions with workers nearby is still restricted by the limited cognitive capacity of the operator, who is executing tasks that are themselves cognitively effortful. The aim of this study is to propose a real-time warning system using visual data acquired from cameras that are readily available in the heavy equipment to protect the workers from potentially dangerous situations involving equipment operations. For this purpose, possible collisions with workers in the workspace of heavy equipment are detected and monitored by estimating the workers\u2019 positions in three dimensions (3D) with a monocular camera on each side of the equipment. Field tests were conducted to verify the accuracy and speed of the system, as well as its applicability to actual construction sites. The proposed system was implemented on two different sizes of excavators while the excavators performed excavating and moving tasks at various construction sites. The field test results indicate that the proposed system can provide information to the operator in real time about whether one or more workers may have come into contact with the equipment during manipulation and transportation of the equipment.

Although software algorithms have successfully demonstrated the ability to automate defect detection, many data collection platforms, such as drones and ground vehicles, still require an operator to control the robot via teleoperation, and they do not adequately address the challenges associated with automating data collection for bridge inspection, which is central to achieve repeatability of inspections over time. In this study, the challenges associated with automating data collection for visual inspection of bridges are addressed using a ground-based robot, and an autonomy framework, which can meet the requirements for management and execution of inspection plans, is presented. Key tasks considered in this study are managing inspection plan execution on a ground-based robot, robot localization and mapping, and autonomous navigation in a bridge environment.

To determine the effects, if any, of staged construction practices on long-term bridge performance, this research examined bridge decks in Wisconsin that were constructed or widened using staged construction through visual inspection, field monitoring, and finite-element modeling. Some minor defects were observed in the field inspections of slab-on-girder bridges, such as underconsolidated concrete in the construction joint region and leakage through the joint itself. The inspected haunched-slab bridges showed severe deterioration at the construction joints. Field-measured differential displacements were small, with a maximum of 1.1\u2009mm (0.043 in.), both during construction and several weeks after. Finite-element modeling confirmed these observations. Modeling results indicated that as long as nominal stiffness was provided by the deck or even the formwork between girders adjacent to the longitudinal joint, these deflections were unlikely to cause deterioration.

When construction hazards remain unrecognized, workers are more likely to indulge in unsafe behavior, experience unanticipated hazard exposure, and suffer catastrophic injuries. To improve our understanding of why construction hazards remain unrecognized, the current study examined hazard recognition as an everyday visual search task\u2014similar to an individual searching for a product in a supermarket, a radiologist examining a radiograph for tissue abnormalities, or a security personnel screening baggage at an airport terminal. More specifically, the research used eye-tracking technology to examine the relationship between visual search patterns adopted by workers while participating in a hazard recognition activity and the resulting performance levels (i.e.,\u00a0hazard recognition performance). The research also focused on testing the effects of introducing a recently developed personalized training intervention on visual search patterns adopted by workers\u2014and the subsequent hazard recognition performance. Visual search patterns examined in the study included search duration, fixation count, fixation spatial density, and others identified from past research. The results reveal that several quantifiable visual search patterns are predictive of superior hazard recognition performance. For example, workers who spent more time examining the workplace for safety hazards (i.e.,\u00a0search duration) recognized a larger proportion of hazards. Likewise, workers that devoted higher levels of attention through a larger number of fixations (i.e.,\u00a0fixation count) and longer fixation durations (i.e.,\u00a0fixation time), and those that distributed their visual attention more broadly across the work area (i.e.,\u00a0fixation spatial density), demonstrated superior performance. The findings also suggest that the adoption of the personalized intervention can lead to improvements in visual search patterns and hazard recognition performance among workers.

However, there is still a need to advance the current methods for improving the productivity of operations and safety on job sites. The excavator is one of the highly used pieces of equipment on construction sites that needs to be monitored to evaluate both safety and productivity. Knowing the productivity of excavators helps to plan the excavation process more accurately. A long queue of trucks waiting for the excavator(s) means paying more money while the trucks are not being loaded. Moreover, excavators have a higher risk of accidents due to their articulated shape compared to other excavation-related equipment.

To test the proposed method, several case studies were conducted in an existing instructional facility, and approximately 3% of the averaged distance errors were reported. Experimental results promise that the proposed multimodal mobile sensing and analytics have significant potential to robustly localize distant in-building assets and reduce the drift errors accumulated in proportion to the moving distance. In addition, the stereoscopic view provides more semantics on the distant target objects, which enables practitioners to improve the associated situational awareness about their performance (e.g.,\u00a0the as-is physical condition).

The objective of this paper is to develop an integrated model based on image processing techniques and artificial intelligence to automate consistent moisture marks detection and numerical representation of the distress in subway networks. The integrated model comprises sequential processors that automatically detect moisture marks on concrete surfaces, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for moisture marks identification and quantification.

Although many research efforts have been made on automatic point cloud registration, prior works have some limitations. Automatic registration was tested in a bounded region and required a large overlapped area between scans. The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel method that achieves automatic point cloud registration in an unbounded region and with a relatively small overlapped area without using artificial targets, landmarks, or any other manual alignment process. For automatic point cloud registration, the proposed framework uses the feature detection algorithms commonly used in computer vision to identify geometric correspondences among the series of scans for the initial alignment. Then, it computes the overlapped area between scans and determines a method to use for the final alignment. If the overlapped area is sufficiently large, the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to generate the proper transformation. Otherwise, a plane-matching algorithm is used to achieve precise registration. The proposed framework was tested at outdoor construction sites and an indoor environment, which resulted in deviation angle accuracy of less than 0.35\u00b0 for outdoor and 0.13\u00b0 for indoor testbeds, respectively, with processing time of less than 4 min.

Human errors\u2014such as failure to identify a hazard\u2014are often attributed to a worker\u2019s lack of attention. Piecemeal attempts have been made to investigate the potential of harnessing eye movements as predictors of human error (e.g.,\u00a0failure to identify a hazard) in the construction industry, although more attempts have investigated human error via subjective measurements. To address this knowledge gap, the present study harnessed eye-tracking technology to evaluate the impacts of workers\u2019 hazard-identification skills on their attentional distributions and visual search strategies. To achieve this objective, an experiment was designed in which the eye movements of 31 construction workers were tracked while they searched for hazards in 35 randomly ordered construction scenario images. Workers were then divided into three groups on the basis of their hazard identification performance. Three fixation-related metrics\u2014fixation count, dwell-time percentage, and run count\u2014were analyzed during the eye-tracking experiment for each group (low, medium, and high hazard-identification skills) across various types of hazards. Then, multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) was used to evaluate the impact of workers\u2019 hazard-identification skills on their visual attention. To further investigate the effect of hazard identification skills on the dependent variables (eye movement metrics), two distinct processes followed: separate ANOVAs on each of the dependent variables, and a discriminant function analysis. The analyses indicated that hazard identification skills significantly impact workers\u2019 visual search strategies: workers with higher hazard-identification skills had lower dwell-time percentages on ladder-related hazards; higher fixation counts on fall-to-lower-level hazards; and higher fixation counts and run counts on fall-protection systems, struck-by, housekeeping, and all hazardous areas combined. Among the eye-movement metrics studied, fixation count had the largest standardized coefficient in all canonical discriminant functions, which implies that this eye-movement metric uniquely discriminates workers with high hazard-identification skills and at-risk workers. Because discriminant function analysis is similar to regression, discriminant function (linear combinations of eye-movement metrics) can be used to predict workers\u2019 hazard-identification capabilities. In conclusion, this study provides a proof of concept that certain eye-movement metrics are predictive indicators of human error due to attentional failure. These outcomes stemmed from a laboratory setting, and, foreseeably, safety managers in the future will be able to use these findings to identify at-risk construction workers, pinpoint required safety training, measure training effectiveness, and eventually improve future personal protective equipment to measure construction workers\u2019 situation awareness in real time.", "keywords": ["Construction safety", "Hazard identification skill", "Eye-tracking technology", "Human error", "Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA)", "Labor and personnel issues"]}, "155": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JSWBAY.0000831", "journal": "Journal of Sustainable Water in the Built Environment", "title": "Use of Fragility Curves to Evaluate the Performance of Green Roofs", "pubyear": "2017", "abstract": "Green infrastructure offers an alternative multibenefit method of runoff reduction in urban areas, using natural processes to infiltrate, store, and treat runoff near its source.

One technique that can be used to measure worker attention is eye tracking, which is widely accepted as the most direct and continuous measure of attention because where one looks is highly correlated with where one is focusing his or her attention. Thus, with the fundamental objective of measuring the impacts of safety knowledge (specifically, training, work experience, and injury exposure) on construction workers\u2019 attentional allocation, this study demonstrates the application of eye tracking to the realm of construction safety practices. To achieve this objective, a laboratory experiment was designed in which participants identified safety hazards presented in 35 construction site images ordered randomly, each of which showed multiple hazards varying in safety risk. During the experiment, the eye movements of 27 construction workers were recorded using a head-mounted EyeLink II system. The impact of worker safety knowledge in terms of training, work experience, and injury exposure (independent variables) on eye-tracking metrics (dependent variables) was then assessed by implementing numerous permutation simulations. The results show that tacit safety knowledge acquired from work experience and injury exposure can significantly improve construction workers\u2019 hazard detection and visual search strategies. The results also demonstrate that (1) there is minimal difference, with or without the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 10-h certificate, in workers\u2019 search strategies and attentional patterns while exposed to or seeing hazardous situations; (2) relative to less experienced workers (<5 years), more experienced workers (>10 years) need less processing time and deploy more frequent short fixations on hazardous areas to maintain situational awareness of the environment; and (3) injury exposure significantly impacts a worker\u2019s visual search strategy and attentional allocation. In sum, practical safety knowledge and judgment on a jobsite requires the interaction of both tacit and explicit knowledge gained through work experience, injury exposure, and interactive safety training. This study significantly contributes to the literature by demonstrating the potential application of eye-tracking technology in studying the attentional allocation of construction workers. Regarding practice, the results of the study show that eye tracking can be used to improve worker training and preparedness, which will yield safer working conditions, detect at-risk workers, and improve the effectiveness of safety-training programs.", "keywords": []}, "159": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29SU.1943-5428.0000221", "journal": "Journal of Surveying Engineering", "title": "Web-Based Georeferenced 3D Inspection and Monitoring of Bridges with Unmanned Aircraft Systems", "pubyear": "2017", "abstract": "The presented paper focuses on the interregional usage of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for infrastructural inspection as well as structural health monitoring (SHM).

The UAS inspection is performed by visual cameras or thermal imagers for state detection, whereas object contours are scanned by LiDAR to allow precise close-range inspection and trajectory control. There are challenges in maintaining the precise laser distance control at the infrastructure, such as the LiDAR sensor measurement accuracy and infrastructural and environmental conditions. The presented bridge-specific flight pattern navigation is an essential trajectory planning tool for acquiring reproducible inspection data and its quality. Based on the UAS inspection data, ultrahigh resolution reconstructions of every part of an object are built in terms of two-dimensional (2D) projections before being postprocessed in a full three-dimensional (3D) building model.

A common goal in increasing building information model (BIM) adoption by the industry is the movement toward the realization of a BIM as either a single data model or a series of tightly coupled federated models.

This paper proposes a framework that is able to provide a solution for managing collaboration in the architecture engineering and construction (AEC) sector. The solution presented in this paper provides an overlay that automatically federates and governs distributed BIM data. The use of this overlay provides an integrated BIM model that is physically distributed across the stakeholders in a construction project.

Unfortunately, recent research has demonstrated that a large proportion of safety hazards remain unrecognized in construction workplaces. To improve hazard-recognition levels, employers adopt a variety of safety and hazard-recognition training programs. However, desirable levels of hazard recognition have not been achieved, and the expected benefits from training have not been attained. Such failure in training efforts have generally been attributed to the adoption of poor and ineffective training practices. While efforts are being undertaken to address these issues, construction research has not focused on developing or evaluating personalized training solutions that are customized to the learning needs of individual workers. To advance theory and practice, the objective of this study was to develop the first personalized training strategy targeted at improving hazard-recognition levels. The objective was accomplished by a collaborative effort involving two industry experts and three academic researchers, along with guidance from training literature. The training strategy incorporates important elements known to improve stimuli or threat detection in domains including medicine, the military, and aviation.

Thereafter, a fast directional chamfer matching algorithm is used to detect the excavator components, and the detected components are articulated at the key nodes. Finally, the three-dimensional positions of the key nodes are tracked through triangulation to depict the excavator movements.

The main feature of the new system is the use of relatively short [6\u201312 m (20\u201340\u2009ft)] straight girder segments that are joined and posttensioned to form a full-length curved girder. The visual impact of the deviation of these chords from a true curve is indistinguishable by a casual observer.

Another feature of the new system is utilization of two of the most commonly used precast concrete girder shapes: I-girder and U-girder. The straight-line bridge girder forms and prestressing bed can be used for the proposed curved girder system, saving considerable initial capital and allowing more precasters to compete for this type of bridge.

Although various safety guidelines have been developed, workers cannot always be aware of everything that occurs around them when they focus on their work on noisy and congested job sites. Therefore, it is difficult for workers to conform to guidelines to protect themselves when confronting dangerous situations. To address this safety issue, this paper presents an on-site safety-assessment system for monitoring struck-by accidents with moving entities based on computer vision and fuzzy inference. Computer vision is used to monitor a construction site and extract spatial information for each entity (workers and equipment). Next, fuzzy inference is used to assess the proper safety levels of each entity using spatial information. A safety level represents the potential hazard or the integrating danger that a person encounters at a particular moment. Struck-by accidents are selected as a target safety hazard for validation. The proposed system is expected to provide valuable information regarding worker safety represented as a numerical value. Using the record of safety levels, site managers can improve current working practices. For example, site managers can sound an alarm for workers when the safety level is too low.", "keywords": ["Occupational safety", "Construction sites", "Labor", "Construction equipment", "Computer vision", "Monitoring", "Fuzzy inference"]}, "181": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CP.1943-5487.0000540", "journal": "Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering", "title": "Alternative Method for Assessing the Roughness Coefficients of Rock Joints", "pubyear": "2015", "abstract": "The roughness of rock joints is a relevant factor considerably influencing the shear strength of rock masses, which is critical for the mechanical stability of large civil engineering structures.

Four 2.13\u00a0m-long SRHDPE pipes with a diameter of 0.61\u00a0m were connected and buried in a trench with dimensions of 1.52\u00a0m wide, 9.15\u00a0m long, and 1.40\u00a0m deep. Two types of backfill material were used in the trench, namely, Aggregate Base Class 3 (AB3) aggregate and crushed stone. Two pipes were buried in the AB3 aggregate section with an average degree of compaction of 90.4% whereas the other two pipes were installed in the crushed stone section with an average degree of compaction of 89.5%. The soil cover thickness in both the AB3 aggregate and the crushed stone sections was 0.65\u00a0m. A vibratory plate compactor was used to compact the backfill material inside the trench. Pipe deflections in the vertical, horizontal, and 45\u00b0 directions from the pipe crown were monitored during backfilling. Earth pressures around the pipes were measured during the construction. Test results indicate that (1)\u00a0the peaking deflection of the pipe in the AB3 aggregate section was 1.5\u00a0times that in the crushed stone section; however, the vertical diameter change of the pipe in the crushed stone section was 3.5\u00a0times that in the AB3 aggregate section after backfilling above the top of the pipe. The pipe diameter change in the crushed stone section in the 45\u00b0 direction from the pipe crown was greater than that in the AB3 aggregate section. The deflections of the SRHDPE pipe in these two types of backfill material with a soil cover thickness of 0.65\u00a0m were much less than the 5% deflection limit suggested for steel and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes by the AASHTO; and (2)\u00a0the soil arching factors at the top of the pipe in both sections are greater than one (i.e.,\u00a0negative soil arching). The measured lateral earth pressure data verified that the lateral pressure induced by compaction was constant with depth within the pipe range. The measurement of the displacements of ribs at the springlines of pipes in both sections demonstrated that the ribs in the crushed stone section deformed more than those in the AB3 section. A visual inspection of the exhumed pipes did not find any obvious damage to the pipe ribs and liner.

Despite the explosion of these methods, the ability to automatically recognize and understand worker and equipment activities from videos is still rather limited. The current algorithms require large-scale annotated workface assessment video data to learn models that can deal with the high degree of intraclass variability among activity categories. To address current limitations, this study proposes crowdsourcing the task of workface assessment from jobsite video streams. By introducing an intuitive web-based platform for massive marketplaces such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and several automated methods, the intelligence of the crowd is engaged for interpreting jobsite videos. The goal is to overcome the limitations of the current practices of workface assessment and also provide significantly large empirical data sets together with their ground truth that can serve as the basis for developing video-based activity recognition methods. Six extensive experiments have shown that engaging nonexperts on AMT to annotate construction activities in jobsite videos can provide complete and detailed workface assessment results with 85% accuracy.

These bridges have generally performed well during the initial years after construction, but recent failures in Pennsylvania and Indiana have aroused a nationwide alarm to investigate the causes of failure and find solutions to repair these bridges or develop designs for new replacement bridges. It was found that the stressed and nonstressed embedded reinforcements were severely corroded owing to the ingress of chloride ions in the bridge deck through the surface cracks occurring within the closure pours (shear key) and at the interface of the joints between the precast elements and the closure pours. This paper addresses the corrosion activity of embedded steel bars within the closure pours. The experimental investigation consisted of two types of samples: uncracked and cracked slabs, containing regular precast concrete with different closure pours, namely, Quikrete with polyvinyl acetate (PVA) fibers, Ductal with PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) fibers, and Ductal with steel fibers. These specimens were exposed to 3% NaCl solution for the duration of 2 weeks in alternate cycles of wet and dry periods to accelerate the corrosion process. Electrochemical measurements along with the visual inspection revealed active corrosion at the interface of two materials, closure pour and precast concrete, regardless of the materials used in closure pours. This indicates that the bonding at the interface is not strong enough to prevent chloride penetration.

In this paper, a novel vision-based method is proposed to automate the monitoring of whether people are wearing hardhats on the construction sites. Under the method, human bodies and hardhats are first detected in the video frames captured by on-site construction cameras. Then, the matching between the detected human bodies and hardhats is performed using their geometric and spatial relationship. This way, the people who are not wearing hardhats could be automatically identified and safety alerts could be issued correspondingly. The method has been tested with real site videos.

Whereas common inspection methods (e.g.,\u00a0visual inspection or acoustic sounding) are sufficient to broadly identify deboned regions, it is difficult to reliably and accurately define the boundaries of bond defects, as is often required by acceptance criteria. Infrared thermography is a more sophisticated alternative, but the results of its application are influenced by ambient environmental conditions and operator interpretation of the data. Further, for applications in which multiple layers of CFRP are required, none of these techniques are capable of fully characterizing existing bond defects, including the depth through the thickness. To this end, pulse phase thermography (PPT) has the potential to more reliably and accurately detect the location and size of bond defects. By observing images in the frequency domain, one is able to identify a specific \u201cblind frequency\u201d at which a certain defect is no longer visible, and thereby also predict the defect\u2019s depth through the thickness. This paper presents a procedure using PPT to develop a calibrated equation based on blind frequency, specific to the strengthening system, which allows for one to predict the interface at which a bond defect is present for externally bonded CFRP-to-concrete systems.

Combined stochastic-deterministic system identification is applied to the acquired input-output data from the vibration testing to estimate the modal parameters of the infill wall for both the in-service state and in the postblast condition with damage characterized by interfacial cracking and permanent set deformation. Structural identification by global optimization of a modal parameter-based objective function using genetic algorithm is employed over two stages to produce calibrated finite-element models of the wall in the preblast and postblast conditions.

This paper briefly reviews the historical development of engineering hydrology education from the middle of the twentieth century. The twentieth century was characterized by the establishment in the 1950s and 1960s of a clear, modern, and durable vision for hydrology education as a distinct formal program of study, and the consolidation in the 1990s of the original vision. In recent years, a series of publications has expanded the traditional vision of hydrology education. This recent literature emphasizes formalized approaches to hydrology education, including community-developed curricular resources, data-based and modeling-based curricula, formally assessed pedagogies, and formalization of nontraditional pedagogies. Based on these findings, the authors present several challenges for hydrology education in the 21st century. Central themes of the challenges for hydrology education are the development of international hydrology education communities and networks, shared learning technologies\u2014partially driven by the need for a more mechanistic approach to engineering hydrology, formalized and validated pedagogies, and adaptations of international best educational practices to regionally specific hydrology and socioeconomic context.", "keywords": ["Hydrology", "Engineering education", "Hydrology", "Education", "Pedagogy", "Priorities", "Science", " technology", " engineering", " and mathematics (STEM)", "Engineering", "Challenges"]}, "201": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CF.1943-5509.0000536", "journal": "Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities", "title": "Using Orthophotography Based on BuildingsLife Software to Inspect Building Facades", "pubyear": "2013", "abstract": "The financial resources available for infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation are always limited, creating a need for efficient resources management and for the ability to predict maintenance actions throughout the infrastructure service period.

Despite its importance, current practice of highway asset data collection is time-consuming, subjective, and potentially unsafe. The high volume of the data that needs to be collected can also negatively impact the quality of the analysis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new algorithm for semantic segmentation and recognition of highway assets using video frames collected from a car-mounted camera. The proposed set of algorithms (1)\u00a0takes the captured frames and using a pipeline of structure from motion and multiview stereo reconstructs a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud model of the highway and surrounding assets; (2)\u00a0using a Semantic Texton Forest classifier, each geo-registered two-dimensional (2D) video frame at the pixel-level is segmented based on shape, texture, and color of the highway assets; and finally, (3)\u00a0based on the results of the 2D segmentation and a new voting scheme, each reconstructed 3D point in the cloud is also categorized for one type of asset and is color coded accordingly. The resulting augmented reality environment that integrates the color-coded point clouds with the geo-registered video frames enables a user to conduct visual walk through and query different categories of assets. Experiments were performed on a challenging video data set containing sequences filmed from a moving car on a 2.2-mi-long, two-lane highway research facility. Experimental results with an average accuracy of 76.50 and 86.75% in segmentation and pixel-level recognition of 12 types of asset categories reflect the promise of the applicability of this approach for segmentation and recognition of highway assets from image-based 3D point clouds.

With increasing insulation values in construction practice, the focus turns to the prevention of thermal bridging as well as airtight construction to reduce unwanted heat transfer through the envelope. The building envelope serves multiple functions apart from heat retention that are tied to structure, safety, and visual appeal or aesthetics; and the stakeholders in the design and construction process all have different decision criteria. Supported by disciplinary education separating engineering and architecture and based on the dogma of Modern Architecture, most contemporary architects consider slender details and clear separation of architectural elements to be intrinsic to good architectural design thinking. The engineer involved in the design of the HVAC systems considers the envelope as the basis for the load calculation, whereas the construction engineer and project manager prioritize cost, maintenance, and constructability. Tradeoffs have to be considered and possibly a new proportional relationship has to be found for a building envelope between the increased need for insulation, seals and gaskets, structural necessities, and exterior appearance; and ideally without penetrating elements that could conduct heat from hot to cold. Considering current construction techniques, conceptual design thinking, proportional relationships, and building science, this paper analyzes energy efficient envelope construction methods and details strategies of the U.S. DOE 2009 Solar Decathlon homes. The paper will evaluate the influence that envelope construction methods which prevent thermal bridges have on the potential to develop a coherent exterior and interior appearance, thermal performance, and constructability to develop a balance between materials and thermodynamics. Different value systems exist within the design team related to the building envelope and lead to a trade-off pentagram. For architects, the envelope carries aesthetic, symbolic, and sometimes even cultural meaning, while it is just one of many parameters for the load calculation of the HVAC engineer and a means to protect the structural elements of a building and to protect against water and fire for the construction engineer.

These agencies use data on asset conditions to make decisions regarding the timing of maintenance activities, the type of treatment, and the resources to employ. To collect and record these data, agencies often utilize trained evaluators who assess the asset either on site or by analyzing photos and/or videos. These visual assessments are widely used to evaluate conditions of various assets, including pavement surface distresses. This paper describes a Data Quality Assessment & Improvement Framework (DQAIF) to measure and improve the performance of multiple evaluators of pavement distresses by controlling for subjective judgment by the individual evaluators. The DQAIF is based on a continuous quality improvement cyclic process that is based on the following main components: (1)\u00a0assessment of the consistency over time\u2014performed using linear regression analysis; (2)\u00a0assessment of the agreement between evaluators\u2014performed using inter-rater agreement analysis; and (3)\u00a0implementation of management practices to improve the results shown by the assessments. A large and comprehensive case study was employed to describe, refine, and validate the framework. When the DQAIF is applied to pavement distress data collected on site by different evaluators, the results show that it is an effective method for quickly identifying and solving data collection issues. The benefit of this framework is that the analyses employed produce performance measures during the data collection process, thus minimizing the risk of subjectivity and suggesting timely corrective actions. The DQAIF can be used as part of an asset management program, or in any engineering program in which the data collected are subjected to the judgment of the individuals performing the evaluation.

The appropriate design of a vertical slot fishway depends on the interplay between hydraulic and biological variables because the hydrodynamic properties of the fishway must match the requirements of the fish species for which it is intended. One of the primary difficulties associated with studies of real fish behavior in fishway models is that the existing mechanisms to measure the behavior of the fish in these assays, such as direct observation or placement of sensors on the specimens, are impractical or unduly affect the animal behavior. This paper proposes a new procedure for measuring the behavior of the fish. The proposed technique uses artificial neural networks and computer vision techniques to analyze images obtained from the assays by means of a camera system designed for fishway integration. It is expected that this technique will provide detailed information about the fish behavior, and it will help to improve fish passage devices, which is currently a subject of interest in the area of civil engineering. A series of assays has been performed to validate this new approach in a full-scale fishway model with living fish.

In this context, architects and engineers often relegate themselves to a minimal supervisory role during construction and planning. The writers have found several recurring instances of terrazzo cracking problems during construction as well as deterioration that could be prevented or minimized with attention to the responsibilities of all parties to communicate throughout the design process. Causes are often related to shrinkage of terrazzo, concentrated stresses attributable to configuration of divider strips, and impact loads. To objectively minimize deterioration rates of terrazzo, an experimental program was initiated to evaluate performance. Testing consisted of compressive strength and linear shrinkage tests on cementitious terrazzo under varying curing conditions and a durability test that applied a cyclic gravity wheel load to gaps at the edge of terrazzo tiles. The latter test used metal wheels and considered parameters of material type, gap size between terrazzo edge and adjacent steel plate, wheel diameter, vertical offset of tile, and vertical load being applied. Results indicated that proper curing of cementitious terrazzo is critical to achieving compressive strength and minimizing early shrinkage. For the durability test performed, epoxy terrazzo exhibited significantly less deterioration. Durability of terrazzo is affected primarily by gap size, upward vertical offset, and weight applied. Small wheel size and direction of loading can also contribute to deterioration. It is important that architects, engineers, and contractors understand methods that ensure material properties, minimize stress concentrations, and use appropriate divider strip spacing to minimize deterioration attributable to cracking and impact load. These steps will ensure the visual appearance and durability expected by the project team.", "keywords": ["Floors", "Deterioration", "Cracking", "Laboratory tests", "Rehabilitation", "Terrazzo", "Floors", "Deterioration", "Cracking", "Laboratory tests"]}, "245": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29EI.1943-5541.0000038", "journal": "Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice", "title": "Enhancing Transportation Education through Online Simulation Using an Agent-Based Demand and Assignment Model", "pubyear": "2010", "abstract": "This research explores the effectiveness of using simulation as a tool for enhancing classroom learning in the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota at Twin Cities.

In this paper, we demonstrate how a BOCDA-based optical fiber strain sensor can be employed to monitor cracks in fiber-reinforced concrete. Crack monitoring is important for checking the structure of such high-performance concrete, which has enhanced strength and toughness since it incorporates fibers. In particular, early detection of tiny cracks is essential for preventing crack growth and dispersion. We carried out a concrete beam-bending test to detect crack-induced strain distribution during loading.

Data from sensors, digital image based surface cracking studies, visual observations of shoulder cracking, and surficial erosion surveys of all test sections were collected and statistically analyzed and these results indicated that the BSC amendments provided the best subsoil enhancements by controlling moisture and temperature fluctuations from the high temperature environment, thereby reducing shrinkage cracks in subsoils and in the adjacent paved highway shoulders.

However, one major critical characteristic of the construction industry is the high cost incurred by the resolution of arising conflicts in projects.

This paper discusses the dynamic nature of conflicts in terms of their evolution and escalation within a project and the interaction between conflicts and dispute avoidance and resolution techniques (DART). The paper also presents the background and development of a conflict management system, entitled the DART Simulator (DART-S). The intent of the DART-S is to provide project managers with a comprehensive and integrated approach to evaluate the impact of a DART implementation on the reduction of conflicts. The simulator was built using a system dynamic modeling within a visual simulation environment. The core of the simulator was developed by using data from literature on the nature of conflicts, dispute resolution processes, and the potential effectiveness of 46 different DART-S on conflict avoidance and resolution. The simulator was then tested and verified with a case study comparing the traditional two-step dispute resolution process with a five-step dispute resolution process. The results of this comparison clearly show that the five-step dispute resolution process is able to decrease the initial number of conflicts of a project, reduce the number of conflicts which may escalate to a higher step in the resolution process, and provide resolutions of conflicts before they reach litigation. By quantifying the amount of conflicts, evaluating the evolution of conflicts, and assessing the impact of DART implementation on conflict escalation, the DART-S provides project managers with an integrated strategy for conflict management.", "keywords": ["Conflicts", "Negotiations", "Dispute resolution", "Construction industry"]}, "270": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9364%282006%29132%3A7%28767%29", "journal": "Journal of Construction Engineering and Management", "title": "Paving the Way to the Vision of Digital Construction: A Strategic Roadmap", "pubyear": "2006", "abstract": "The paper provides a synthesis of the construction industry needs and requirements in relation to the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICT).

Since the resources required to perform these activities move from one stage to the other, a main objective of scheduling these projects is to maintain the continuity of work of these resources so as to minimize the idle time of resources. This requirement, often referred to as work continuity constraints, involves a tradeoff between total project duration and the resource idle time. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we provide an extensive literature summary of the topic under study. Although most research papers deal with the scheduling of construction projects, we show that this can be extended to many other environments. Second, we propose an exact search procedure for scheduling repetitive projects with work continuity constraints. This algorithm iteratively shifts repeating activities further in time in order to decrease the resource idle time. We have embedded this recursive search procedure in a horizon-varying algorithm in order to detect the complete tradeoff profile between resource idle time and project duration. The procedure has been coded in Visual C++ and has been validated on a randomly generated problem set. Finally, we illustrate the concepts on three examples. First, the use of our new algorithm is illustrated on a small fictive problem example from literature. In a second example, we show that work continuity constraints involve a tradeoff between total project duration and the resource idle time.

The results of the field and laboratory investigation show the cracking was not initiated by steel corrosion, deleterious reactions in the concrete materials, or an inadequate structural design. Rather, the cracking is related to settlement of the steel bars in the concrete. Settlement cracking is conventionally thought to occur only in concrete slabs and decks with plastic (high slump) concrete and small values of bar cover depth, while the studied CRCP sections have large values of cover depth and were cast with stiff (low slump) concrete. The settlement was likely caused by the relative settlement of heavy steel bars (22mm diameter) within the lower density concrete during the original CRCP construction.

A Laser-based system was used to measure surface texture and to detect segregation. Two segregated test sections and a control test section were tested to evaluate the applicability of Laser texture method to detect and quantify segregation. Laser texture data were gathered from all three sections. Ratios of texture in segregated areas to that in nonsegregated areas were set as the basis for detection of different levels of segregation. By combining the level of segregation and extent of segregation, an AREA index was developed to determine the acceptability of a pavement section. Based on AREA index, pay adjustment factors were proposed to reduce the payment to account for loss of pavement life due to segregation. Further remedial actions were proposed to correct segregated pavement sections with acceptable AREA index. Based on the above concepts, Windows-based computer program NJTxtr was developed to detect and quantify segregation. This computer program uses the Laser-equipment-collected pavement texture data and determines whether the pavement section is acceptable or unacceptable based on the level of segregation within a pavement section, and provides bonus or penalties to the contractor.

A hydroelectric project, which will take place on the Yellow River in the northwest of China, is used as an example. An optimum equipment set scheme is determined by simulating a variety of scenarios taking place under different construction conditions. Likewise, other parameters, such as the construction sequence of dam blocks, the monthly intensity of the concrete process, and the construction appearance at the middle and end of each year, are obtained.

The accuracy and reliability of documentation generated during these inspections are critical to the allocation of Department of Transportation construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation resources. Routine inspections are typically completed using only the visual inspection technique and rely heavily on subjective assessments made by bridge inspectors. In light of this, and given the fact that visual inspection may have other limitations that influence its reliability, the Federal Highway Administration initiated an investigation to examine the reliability of visual inspection as it is currently applied to bridges in the United States. This paper will summarize results from this study related to the accuracy and reliability of routine inspection documentation. A number of important conclusions were developed from the experimental study. Generally, it was found that all structural condition documentation is collected with significant variability. Specifically, 95% of primary element condition ratings for individual bridge components will vary within two rating points of the average and only 68% will vary within one point. Documentation generally collected to support condition ratings also has significant variability as exemplified by the number and types of field notes and photographs taken by inspectors. With respect to the use of element-level inspections, it was found that element usage was generally consistent with the Commonly Recognized Element Guide. However, there is significant variability in the condition state assignments of those elements and in some cases the condition states are not applied correctly to particular elements.

The laboratory experiment is developed using relatively inexpensive soil permeability testing equipment common to most academic and industrial geotechnical engineering laboratories. Unlike conventional chemical transport testing, which requires relatively complicated, time consuming, and expensive analytical instrumentation, the new laboratory exercise relies on the use of simple colored dye for simulating the movement of a contaminant through a one-dimensional soil column. The key soil parameters governing the transport of the dye, including the diffusion coefficient, hydraulic conductivity, dispersion coefficient, and retardation coefficient, are quantified by observing the location and color intensity of the dye as it moves through the column.

One aspect of this automation is the detection of cracks and deterioration of a bridge. This paper provides a comparison of the effectiveness of four crack-detection techniques: fast Haar transform (FHT), fast Fourier transform, Sobel, and Canny.

Many uses exist for the vehicle- and infrastructure-related information that can be transmitted from motor vehicles. For example, fleet operators can take advantage of this information for better management of their own fleet, subject to privacy agreements with their own drivers. Similarly, this information can be used for traffic control purposes to improve travel times and safety. Even though it is becoming technologically feasible to use motor vehicles to transmit a variety of information collected through sensors, social, technical, and organizational barriers exist currently that limit the availability of this information mostly to the private use of the motor vehicle and drivers.

Five different separator geotextiles and a soil-only control section were installed in each lane. Excavations were made in the test section 5 years after installation, and samples of geotextiles, subgrade, and base course materials were exhumed for visual observation and laboratory testing. In addition, in situ soil tests were performed on the exposed subgrade soils. This paper summarizes these observations and test results. Although some fines from the subgrade had migrated through the geotextiles into the bottom of the base course, there was no evidence after 5 years of any adverse effect on the pavement itself. Minor geotextile damage that apparently occurred during construction had little effect on the pavement performance.

Using information developed for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, types of structural systems that would provide significant increases in toughness to structures subjected to catastrophic loading from events such as major earthquakes and blasts are identified. One of these systems is compartmentalized construction, in which a large percentage of the building has structural walls that are reinforced to provide structural integrity in case the building is damaged. Two additional types of detailing, used in areas of high seismicity, are special moment frame construction and dual systems with special moment frames (herein referred to as dual systems).

There is an abundance of highly developed CPM computer applications available today. These applications provide a rich set of capabilities such as resource and cost allocation, progress reporting, and schedule updating, plus the generation of a multitude of reports and graphics. There are no comparable applications for linear scheduling. The reason for the shortage of applications is that linear scheduling typically has been regarded as a visual technique lacking the analytical qualities of the CPM of scheduling. Fundamental to linear scheduling's lack of an analytical perspective is its inability to determine a critical path.

The first two of these parameters can be determined by marigraphic measurements or by visual observations; however, wavefront, orientation, which is an important variable in the construction and operation of a hydraulic model, has never been accurately observed at the problem site (Crescent City, California). A digital computer program was written to plot wave rays from tsunami sources to obtain tsunami-front orientations in the Crescent City area. The refraction diagrams are checked by comparing the computed and actual arrival times of the initial wave fronts. The actual arrival times were obtained from recording tide stations at Crescent City and Hilo, Hawaii. Initial wave-front orientations near the earthquake epicenter are either assumed or taken from the literature. The computer program has been successfully tested against a closed form solution for the refraction around a selected island shape.

Efficient structural design must recognize wood's unique structural properties and use them correctly. The way in which results of standard tests on wood arc transformed into safe working stresses for structural design is summarized, and the factor of safety is considered. Reference is made to the structural grading of wood, emphasizing the importance of variability, and how this is accounted for in both visual and machining grading. In designing with wood, the designer needs to know about such inherent properties as strength with or across the grain, and about the place of fastenings.

Manual efforts primarily collect the necessary traffic demand data live in the field or from video recordings using an extensive data manipulation process. Alternative solutions include computer-based systems that perform human tasks more efficiently and with less time and effort, and these systems vary in function and performance. This paper proposes a comprehensive computer-based system that detects, tracks, and computes related statistics in real time while making the best use of available resources, such as public road surveillance cameras. The main contribution of this work is the effectiveness of combining various computer vision algorithms to achieve high-accuracy performance during real-time streaming of road cameras. The experiments confirm the system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance by achieving an average success rate of 93.2%. The novel aspect of this work is that detections, point extractions, matching, tracking, and classification were implemented in a single system that ensures real-time execution and high-accuracy output and uses existing infrastructure. The system compensates for the variations in light between day and night and between cloudy and sunny weather. It also recovers hidden vehicles and changes in view for each vehicle as it moves. The proposed method efficiently and partially integrates some mechanisms into a single system.", "keywords": ["Traffic volumes", "Vehicle counting", "Detection", "You only look once (YOLO)", "Speeded up robust feature (SURF)", "Feature points", "Channel and spatial reliability tracker (CSRT)", "Business management", "Cameras", "Computing in civil engineering", "Data collection", "Detection methods", "Engineering fundamentals", "Equipment and machinery", "Highway transportation", "Human and behavioral factors", "Infrastructure", "Intelligent transportation systems", "Methodology (by type)", "Practice and Profession", "Research methods (by type)", "Tracking", "Traffic engineering", "Traffic management", "Traffic surveillance", "Transportation engineering", "Transportation management", "Vehicles"]}, "364": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/geosek.0000410", "journal": "GEOSTRATA Magazine", "title": "Infrastructure and Community Resilience", "pubyear": "2022", "abstract": "The $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law on November 15, 2021, has raised high hopes among the general public and decision-makers to set a new paradigm for enhancing the condition of our nation's aging infrastructure. The bill includes $550 billion of funding for rebuilding and strengthening infrastructure systems in several critical sectors (e.g., transportation, energy, and water), with a vision toward adaptation to climate change. Further, the bill includes a huge commitment for creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs in a rather short period of time to address infrastructure issues. So now with funding and a general plan in place, a key question we should ask of our future workforce educators is: are our higher education systems and workforce development plans prepared and equipped to facilitate implementation of this plan? When discussing issues related to infrastructure resilience and adaptation, we often highlight the need to better educate decision-makers and the general people to understand the importance of these topics. But before reaching that point, how much do we really prepare our own civil and construction engineering students?", "keywords": []}}}}
