Manual processing of point cloud datasets is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. A variety of automatic approaches, such as machine learning methods, are adopted in different steps of automatic processing of point clouds. This article surveys recent research on point cloud datasets, which were automatically processed with machine learning methods in construction and infrastructure industries.

The carbon emission factor method, mass balance method, and actual measurement method are analyzed. The top-down and bottom-up carbon emission accounting models and their subdivision models are introduced and analyzed. Individual building carbon emission assessments generally adopt a bottom-up physical model, while urban carbon emission assessments generally adopt a top-down economic input-output model. Most of the current studies on building carbon emission prediction models follow the path of \"exploring influencing factors then putting forward prediction models based on influencing factors\". The studies on driving factors of carbon emission mainly use the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model, the grey correlation degree model, and other models. The prediction model is realized by the regression model, the system dynamics model, and other mathematical models, as well as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and other machine learning models.

Although a number of studies in recent years have aimed to analyze cybersecurity issues in the construction sector, further research investment in this area is vital. The first step towards identifying needed and promising research directions in this domain is to systematically analyze the existing body of knowledge and detect knowledge gaps. This study addresses this need through a systematic scoping review designed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR). To synthesize the existing knowledge, the extracted information is mapped with multiple benchmarks, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for cybersecurity management. The outcomes of the scoping review indicated that, from the construction perspective, the existing literature mainly focuses on a few areas, including Building Information Modeling (BIM), while other digital systems such as construction robots and prefabrication platforms need to be considered in future works. In terms of cybersecurity management, most of the existing studies focus on identifying risks and protecting assets. Other aspects of cybersecurity management, including detecting intrusions, responding to threats, and recovering from cyber-attacks need to be addressed in future studies. Regarding the technology-mediated countermeasures, the existing studies have explored only a limited number of potential solutions with a considerable focus on Blockchain-based systems, while the application of other countermeasures such as network virtualization can be a basis for future studies.

First, using Digital Twins to detect building faults to prevent future failures and cutting overall costs by improving building maintenance is still ambiguous. Second, how Digital Twin technology may be applied to discover inefficiencies inside the building to optimize energy usage is not well defined.

A five-step review approach was adopted to search and analyze peer-reviewed academic journal articles. A three-level computer vision development framework was proposed to categorized computer vision applications in the construction industry. The links between computer vision and three main safety research traditions: safety management system, behavior-based safety program, and safety culture, were discussed. The results suggest that the majority of past efforts were focused on object recognition, object tracking, and action recognition, with limited research focused on recognizing unsafe behavior. There are even fewer studies aimed at developing vision-based safety assessment and prediction systems. Based on the review findings, four future research directions are suggested: (1) develop and test a behavioral-cues-based safety climate measure, (2) develop safety behavior datasets, (3) develop a formal hazard identification and assessment model, and (4) develop criteria to evaluate the real impacts of vision-based technologies on safety performance.</p>", "keywords": ["Computer vision", "Construction health and safety", "Safety science", "Safety culture", "Safety Climate, Hazard", "Safety management system", "Digital technologies", "Automation", "CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS", "ACTION RECOGNITION", "VISUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY", "EARTHMOVING EXCAVATORS", "HAZARD IDENTIFICATION", "CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK", "ORIENTED GRADIENTS", "VISUAL RECOGNITION", "ONSITE WORKERS", "TRACKING"]}, "40": {"doi": "10.3390/s21165468", "title": "Computer vision-based construction process sensing for cyber\u2013physical systems: A review", "abstract": "Cyber\u2013physical systems (CPSs) are generally considered to be the next generation of engineered systems. However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review. This architecture innovatively introduces computer vision as a sensing method of construction sites, and realizes low-cost and non-invasive information acquisition in complex construction scenarios.

We argue that this new class hierarchy can serve as the main building block for prioritising the automation of the most frequently used object classes for geometric digital twin construction and maintenance.

Critical findings of prevention and hazard recognition were summarized and discussed to have a comprehensive understanding of current progress. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that current safety training methods are generally effective in improving construction safety, though the effectiveness in field studies is lower than in laboratory studies.

However, the construction industry is searching for environmentally sustainable and eco-friendly building materials to fight climate change. Millions of tires are discarded globally, and only certain percentages are recycled. The use of rubber tires as a natural aggregate replacement in concrete has gained popularity among the research community in the past few years, primarily due to its ductility and toughness properties. A significant number of investigations have been reported in the past using recycled coarse aggregates (RCA), crumb rubber (CR), and fibers separately in concrete. The results revealed that the addition of rubber particles along with RCA in concrete reduced the strength. However, the inclusion of fibers in the same mixtures significantly improved the mechanical properties of concrete by acting as a bridge within the concrete matrix for the surrounding cracks. In this review paper, over 220 research articles from the last 30 years reporting the effect of RCA, CR, and fibers on the mechanical and physical properties of rubberized recycled aggregate concrete (RRAC) and fiber-reinforced rubberized recycled aggregate concrete (FRRAC) are summarized. This paper presents in detail the influencing factors that affect the physical and mechanical properties of RRAC and FRRAC. The performance of FRRAC depends on the types of fiber and CR, treatment of CR, RCA sources, and the mix design of concrete. Based on the review, recommendations are provided for optimized FRRAC production.

It is applied widely across different industry sectors (e.g.,\u00a0energy, aerospace, construction, defense, and manufacturing), generally through the use of an earned value management system (EVMS). A holistic and up-to-date literature review on EVM and EVMS does not exist. A literature review can provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic, identifying and summarizing the existing body of knowledge, as a foundation to advance the state of practice of EVM/EVMS. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to investigate the EVM/EVMS state of the art by critically reviewing academic and industry publications, with a specific focus on the maturity of EVMS and the environment surrounding its implementation. By performing a systematic literature review, the authors identified 600 publications since the inception of the EVM concept in 1962, and then narrowed down this list to 160 relevant publications from the last decade for closer review. The findings include the discovery of eight emergent themes. Of these themes, \u201cforecasting/prediction\u201d constitutes the largest portion of the recent literature, followed by \u201capplication of EVMS.\u201d One interesting finding is that EVMS maturity, although being a critical topic, is only discussed in one publication. Publications focused on EVM/EVMS have increased in the last decade and significant differences were found between academia and industry literature in terms of the limitations and extensions of EVM/EVMS, EVMS environment, and compliance. A key finding is that designing a reliable EVMS should combine both technical and social aspects of implementation.

Finally, we offer insights into potential solutions to these challenges, such as innovative sensors and imaging technologies, integration with other construction technologies, and the use of machine learning and AI for data analysis, which are some of the potential areas for future investigation, and highlight the prospects for drone-based construction inspection.</p>", "keywords": ["UAV-based inspection", "construction future directions", "remote sensing", "structural health monitoring", "UAV technology", "UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES", "QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT", "INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY", "SAFETY", "IMAGES", "RECONSTRUCTION", "SEGMENTATION", "RECOGNITION", "INTEGRATION", "EXTRACTION", "construction future directions", "remote sensing", "structural health monitoring", "UAV technology", "UAV-based inspection"]}, "95": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-12290", "title": "Tracking the Research on Ten Emerging Digital Technologies in the AECO Industry", "abstract": "Application of emerging digital technology (DT) is an attractive subject of research and is indispensable to the current goal of intelligent construction in many countries. Relevant studies have either focused on the status of a specific DT or proposed preliminary/qualitative comparisons among DTs. This paper provides a systematic understanding of research on applying DTs to the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry using a mixed-review method. Ten emerging DTs are determined, and publications related to them in 2011\u20132020 are collected from the Scopus database. The overall status and comparisons of research on 10 emerging DTs by region, journal, and popularity are then presented. The content of research on them is examined through in-depth literature analysis (including research scenario, project stage, and literature evolution in a discipline) and theme classification. Future research directions including technology knowledge, development, application and management, and some practical implications for the country, industry, project, and enterprise, are finally proposed. This research will be informative for academics with regard to the emerging DT\u2019s opportunities in this discipline and provide support for work on the digitization of the AECO industry.", "keywords": ["Digital technology (DT)", "Application", "Comparison", "Architecture", " engineering", " construction", " and operation (AECO) industry", "Review"]}, "96": {"doi": "10.3390/buildings13010015", "wos_id": "WOS:000917077300001", "title": "Trends in Adopting BIM, IoT and DT for Facility Management: A Scientometric Analysis and Keyword Co-Occurrence Network Review", "abstract": "<p>Facility Management (FM) regards the management of buildings' assets and requires the administration of a large amount of data that must always be available, but today, they still consist of paper documents, which are susceptible to loss. This is one of the principal causes for costs increase in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase, together with the lack of interoperability and communication. In recent years, the construction industry has been undergoing a process of digitalization, supported from the advent of new technologies that hit the market at low prices. This study aims to indagate the technologies introduced in in the FM sector, in addition the major authors and sources that are studying them. A bibliometric analysis is conducted on 220 documents belonging to the Scopus DB. The documents were analyzed using bibliometric analysis tools, such as Biblioshiny and VOSviewer. The results show how FM and the implementation of technologies in its practices, such as Building information modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Twin (DT), are fields with exponential growth in recent years. Other technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and augmented reality (AR), emerged as part of digitalization in FM, which is part of the transition towards Construction 4.0.</p>", "keywords": ["BIM", "IoT", "facility management", "digital twin", "H-INDEX", "DIGITAL TWINS", "BRADFORD LAW", "BLOCKCHAIN", "CHALLENGES", "INDUSTRY"]}, "97": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29IS.1943-555X.0000691", "title": "Trends, Topics, Leaders, Influential Studies, and Future Challenges of Machine Learning Studies in the Rail Industry", "abstract": "This study reviewed the status quo of research on machine learning (ML), including deep learning, in the rail industry. This study conducted a scientometric analysis and critical review of 640 papers selected from 12,675 web-crawled papers. The extensive and complex networks of topics, researchers, and countries were analyzed using the Louvain method, a co-occurrence keyword analysis, a degree centrality analysis, and other network analysis methods. The results indicate that the majority of studies of ML in the rail industry focused on maintenance activities and traffic management, and mainly targeted rolling stock, rails, and passengers. Overhead contact systems, including catenaries, are a high-demand objective for ML-based maintenance. Although analyses of tunnels and stations remain rare, passenger flow prediction, station air quality estimation, shield tunneling performance improvement, and ground settlement are areas of high importance. Geographically, China, the US, and the United Kingdom lead ML studies in the rail industry, and the level of collaboration is higher among European countries than among countries on other continents.

To encourage the proactive safety management these opportunities present, extensive research efforts have explored using various wearable sensing technologies\u2014including motion sensors (e.g.,\u00a0inertial measurement units) and physiological sensors (e.g.,\u00a0heart-rate sensors, electrodermal-activity sensors, skin-temperature sensors, eye trackers, and brainwave monitors)\u2014to detect potential safety hazards and to continuously monitor a worker\u2019s health on a construction jobsite. However, these efforts tend to be piecemeal or fragmented, which presents a challenge for both the practitioners and the researchers who wish to fully understand the current developments in this area. In this context, this paper provides a critical review of the state of the art of wearable applications in construction safety and health. The review first identifies five general applications within the literature: preventing musculoskeletal disorders, preventing falls, assessing physical workload and fatigue, evaluating hazard-recognition abilities, and monitoring workers\u2019 mental status. Second, this study identifies the challenges impeding further development and deployment of wearable applications, specifically, signal artifacts and noise in wearable-sensors\u2019 field measurements, variable standards for personal safety and health risks in construction, users\u2019 resistance to technology adoption, and uncertainty regarding the return on investment. Lastly, this paper recommends future research opportunities for advancing the field, especially in terms of conducting sensor fusion for wearable applications, developing a business case, and engaging wearables in risk assessment and post-injury compensability assessment.", "keywords": []}}}
