Robotics, as a powerful technology to improve productivity in the digitization era, is being used to assist in addressing these problems. Particularly in recent years, interest in construction robotics research has risen remarkably. To gain a deeper understanding of this burgeoning research field, this study provides a bibliometric analysis of 498 related papers retrieved from WoS (Web of Science). Performance analysis and science mapping were used in the paper to identify the research trends, relationship among authors, top publication sources, regional activities, as well as knowledge base and dominant research sub-fields. The results indicated that the number of papers focusing on construction robotics has been continuously growing since 2013. \u201cAutomation,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and \u201cdesign\u201d have been the most addressed topics in construction robotics. The findings are indicative of identifying the deficiencies in existing research and provide directions for future research. Those include greater attention paid to the experimental results of on-site construction robots, while ignoring the impacts of practical construction situations, and the development of off-site construction robots needs more support. For theoretical research, there is a lack of studies on human\u2013robot collaboration workflow and management models. Therefore, the study would be valuable in providing practitioners and researchers with a better perspective on the development of construction robotics and facilitating the building of the intellectual wealth of robotics in the construction industry.", "keywords": ["Construction robotics", "Automation", "Bibliometric analysis"]}, "2": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JMENEA.MEENG-5445", "title": "Development of Safety Training in Construction: Literature Review, Scientometric Analysis, and Meta-Analysis", "abstract": "The construction industry has a high accident rate, making safety training for construction workers increasingly important in addressing this issue. Previous research on construction safety training has made significant progress, but existing literature reviews lack a comprehensive summary of the development of construction safety training, an evaluation of the effectiveness of current training methods, and an analysis of potential improvements in the future. Therefore, this study addresses these challenges through systematic literature review, scientometric analysis, and meta-analysis. A total of 92 publications since 2001 were included in this study after searching and selection based on the preferred reporting items commonly used in psychological and medical systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This study identified three phases of construction safety training research: determination of the necessity and significance of construction safety training, exploration of different methods for construction safety training, and development of construction safety training tools using advanced technologies. Findings from the scientometric analysis revealed that prevention and hazard recognition are key research topics in the field. Critical findings of prevention and hazard recognition were summarized and discussed to have a comprehensive understanding of current progress. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that current safety training methods are generally effective in improving construction safety, though the effectiveness in field studies is lower than in laboratory studies. Thus, researchers should understand why safety training performance is different between laboratories and construction sites and then control the differences to enhance the effectiveness of construction safety training in the future. This study identified that personalized safety training is a foreseeable development trend and suggested more efforts on the improvement of long-term safety training effectiveness. Additionally, safety training methods should be revised and optimized for the needs of intelligent construction and prefabricated construction. These findings offer new insights into construction safety training for researchers and policymakers.", "keywords": ["Safety training", "Construction worker", "Literature review", "Personalized training", "Intelligent construction", "Prefabricated construction", "Bibliographies", "Business management", "Construction engineering", "Construction management", "Construction methods", "Construction sites", "Education", "Employment", "Engineering fundamentals", "Field tests", "Information management", "Labor", "Laboratory tests", "Occupational safety", "Personnel management", "Practice and Profession", "Public administration", "Public health and safety", "Safety", "Tests (by type)", "Training"]}, "3": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JAEIED.AEENG-1547", "title": "Prospects of Promoting MMC across the Public Construction Sector: A Systematic Review against the Diffusion of Innovation Theory", "abstract": "Despite the calls to transform construction and the potential of modern methods of construction (MMC) to address traditional construction concerns, the global construction industry is yet to embrace the benefits.

The study argues the five functional constructs of the diffusion of innovation theory against MMC attributes. A systematic review of 67 articles through a preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) led to key arguments that explain the lesser drive for MMC adoption.

Although a number of studies in recent years have aimed to analyze cybersecurity issues in the construction sector, further research investment in this area is vital. The first step towards identifying needed and promising research directions in this domain is to systematically analyze the existing body of knowledge and detect knowledge gaps. This study addresses this need through a systematic scoping review designed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR). To synthesize the existing knowledge, the extracted information is mapped with multiple benchmarks, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for cybersecurity management. The outcomes of the scoping review indicated that, from the construction perspective, the existing literature mainly focuses on a few areas, including Building Information Modeling (BIM), while other digital systems such as construction robots and prefabrication platforms need to be considered in future works. In terms of cybersecurity management, most of the existing studies focus on identifying risks and protecting assets. Other aspects of cybersecurity management, including detecting intrusions, responding to threats, and recovering from cyber-attacks need to be addressed in future studies. Regarding the technology-mediated countermeasures, the existing studies have explored only a limited number of potential solutions with a considerable focus on Blockchain-based systems, while the application of other countermeasures such as network virtualization can be a basis for future studies.

These levels are employed to evaluate work sequences over time and also assess the workers\u2019 and equipment\u2019s well-being and abnormal edge cases. Results of an automated performance monitoring system could be used to employ preventive measures to minimize operating/repair costs and downtimes. The authors of this paper have studied the feasibility of implementing a wide range of technologies and computational techniques for automated activity recognition and tracking of construction equipment and workers. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods and techniques as well as describes their advantages, practical value, and limitations. Additionally, a multifaceted comparison between these methods is presented, and potential knowledge gaps and future research directions are discussed.", "keywords": ["Construction equipment", "Worker", "Location tracking", "Activity recognition", "Activity tracking", "Performance monitoring", "Machine learning", "Convolutional neural network", "Audio-based method", "Kinematic-based method", "Vision-based method"]}, "22": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CO.1943-7862.0001678", "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Parametric Construction Cost Estimate Modeling: State-of-the-Art Review", "abstract": "This study reviews the common practices and procedures conducted to identify the cost drivers that the past literature has classified into two main categories: qualitative and quantitative procedures. In addition, the study reviews different computational intelligence (CI) techniques and ensemble methods conducted to develop practical cost prediction models. This study discusses the hybridization of these modeling techniques and the future trends for cost model development, limitations, and recommendations. The study focuses on reviewing the most common artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for cost modeling such as fuzzy logic (FL) models, artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression models, case-based reasoning (CBR), hybrid models, diction tree (DT), random forest (RF), supportive vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, scalable boosting trees (XGBoost), and evolutionary computing (EC) such as genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, this paper provides the comprehensive knowledge needed to develop a reliable parametric cost model at the conceptual stage of the project. Additionally, field canals improvement projects (FCIPs) are used as an actual case study to analyze the performance of the ML models. Out of 20 AI techniques, the results showed that the most accurate and suitable method is XGBoost with 9.091% and 0.929 based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and adjusted R2, respectively. Nonlinear adaptability, handling missing values and outliers, model interpretation, and uncertainty are discussed for the 20 developed AI models. In addition, this study presents a publicly open data set for FCIPs to be used for future model validation and analysis.", "keywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Feature engineering", "Ensemble methods", "Hybrid intelligent systems", "Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process", "Genetic algorithm", "Factor analysis", "Fuzzy logic", "XGBoost", "Project cost modeling", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning", "Benefit cost ratios", "Business management", "Case studies", "Computer models", "Computer programming", "Computing in civil engineering", "Construction costs", "Construction engineering", "Construction management", "Engineering fundamentals", "Financial management", "Fuzzy logic", "Mathematics", "Methodology (by type)", "Models (by type)", "Parameters (statistics)", "Practice and Profession", "Project management", "Research methods (by type)", "Statistics"]}, "23": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CO.1943-7862.0001708", "title": "Wearable Sensing Technology Applications in Construction Safety and Health", "abstract": "The advent of wearable sensing technologies has produced unprecedented opportunities for the near real-time collection and analysis of workers\u2019 safety and health data. To encourage the proactive safety management these opportunities present, extensive research efforts have explored using various wearable sensing technologies\u2014including motion sensors (e.g.,\u00a0inertial measurement units) and physiological sensors (e.g.,\u00a0heart-rate sensors, electrodermal-activity sensors, skin-temperature sensors, eye trackers, and brainwave monitors)\u2014to detect potential safety hazards and to continuously monitor a worker\u2019s health on a construction jobsite. However, these efforts tend to be piecemeal or fragmented, which presents a challenge for both the practitioners and the researchers who wish to fully understand the current developments in this area. In this context, this paper provides a critical review of the state of the art of wearable applications in construction safety and health. The review first identifies five general applications within the literature: preventing musculoskeletal disorders, preventing falls, assessing physical workload and fatigue, evaluating hazard-recognition abilities, and monitoring workers\u2019 mental status. Second, this study identifies the challenges impeding further development and deployment of wearable applications, specifically, signal artifacts and noise in wearable-sensors\u2019 field measurements, variable standards for personal safety and health risks in construction, users\u2019 resistance to technology adoption, and uncertainty regarding the return on investment. Lastly, this paper recommends future research opportunities for advancing the field, especially in terms of conducting sensor fusion for wearable applications, developing a business case, and engaging wearables in risk assessment and post-injury compensability assessment.", "keywords": []}}}}
