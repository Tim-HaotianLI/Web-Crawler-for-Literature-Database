A five-step review approach was adopted to search and analyze peer-reviewed academic journal articles. A three-level computer vision development framework was proposed to categorized computer vision applications in the construction industry. The links between computer vision and three main safety research traditions: safety management system, behavior-based safety program, and safety culture, were discussed. The results suggest that the majority of past efforts were focused on object recognition, object tracking, and action recognition, with limited research focused on recognizing unsafe behavior. There are even fewer studies aimed at developing vision-based safety assessment and prediction systems.

With advances being made in computer vision, the capability exists to automatically capture and identify unsafe behaviour and hazards in real-time from two-dimensional (2D) digital images/videos.

However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review.

Nevertheless, we did not find most of their constructions in the literature. Moreover, we expect that putting them together in a retrospective context would help the reader to grasp current results that usually generalize these fundamental observations. Experts might appreciate the unified notation and comparison table for existing results. Open source code is provided for all presented algorithms, to demonstrate their usage, and to support the readers who are more familiar with programming than mathematics.

The diagnosis of autoimmune blistering skin diseases is based on lesions examination and requires extensive, algorithmic array of immunologic investigations that are available in a few selected centers only and are cost intensive.

This study provides a comprehensive review of how UAV-based damage mapping has evolved from providing simple descriptive overviews of a disaster science, to more sophisticated texture and segmentation-based approaches, and finally to studies using advanced deep learning approaches, as well as multi-temporal and multi-perspective imagery to provide comprehensive damage descriptions. The paper further reviews studies on the utility of the developed mapping strategies and image processing pipelines for first responders, focusing especially on outcomes of two recent European research projects, RECONASS (Reconstruction and Recovery Planning: Rapid and Continuously Updated Construction Damage, and Related Needs Assessment) and INACHUS (Technological and Methodological Solutions for Integrated Wide Area Situation Awareness and Survivor Localization to Support Search and Rescue Teams).

This technology involves extrusion through a nozzle by means of a plunger-, filament-or screw-based mechanism; where necessary, this is preceded by heating of the feedstock material to reduce its viscosity sufficiently to facilitate extrusion. Extrusion -based AM offers greater design freedom, larger building volumes and more cost-efficient production than liquid -and powder-based AM processes. Although this technology was originally developed for polymeric filament materials, it is now increasingly applied to a wide variety of material classes, including metallic, edible and construction materials. This is in part thanks to the recent development of AM-specific feedstock materials (AM materials), in which materials that are not intrinsically suited to extrusion, for example because of high melting points or brittleness, are combined with other, usually polymeric materials that can be more readily extruded. This paper comprehensively and systematically reviews the state of the art in the field of extrusion-based AM, including the techniques applied and the individual challenges and developments in each materials class for which the technology is being developed.

This situation has precipitated the need for more systematic inspections and continual monitoring of infrastructure to assure structural integrity. With the advancement of sensing and computing technologies, rapid, remote, real-time, and robust structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques have been significantly developed. These smart SHM technologies often result in big data that require advanced data management, visualization, diagnostic, and prognostic techniques. Over the past few decades, researchers have developed numerous machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-based damage diagnostic and prognosis methods, which have been systematically reviewed in the recent state-of-the-art papers. In parallel, various data management and visualization techniques have been explored in SHM using building information modeling (BIM), virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). Both BIM and AR/VR present a unique opportunity to document, systematically interpret, and visualize SHM data in a three-dimensional (3D) environment and have shown significant promise in a wide range of infrastructure monitoring applications. Unlike diagnostics and prognostics methods of SHM, there has been a very limited systematic review of the latest visualization and data management techniques, which are both the objective and novelty of this review paper.

While the collection of as-built utility locations is becoming more accurate, there still exists an important need to be capable of accurately detecting buried utilities in order to eliminate risks associated with digging. Current practices typically involve the use of trained agents to survey and detect underground utilities at locations of interest, which is a costly and time-consuming process. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI), an opportunity arose in conducting virtual sensing of buried utilities by combining robotics (e.g., drones), knowledge, and logic. This paper reviewed methods that are based on AI in mapping underground infrastructure. In particular, the use of AI in aerial and terrestrial mapping of utility assets was reviewed, followed by a summary of AI techniques used in fusing multi-source data in creating underground infrastructure maps. Key observations from the consolidated literature were that (1) when leveraging computer vision methods, automatic mapping techniques vastly focus on manholes localized from aerial imagery; (2) when applied to non-intrusive sensing, AI methods vastly focus on empowering ground-penetrating radar (GPR)-produced data; and (3) data fusion techniques to produce utility maps should be extended to any utility assets/types. Based on these observations, a universal utility mapping model was proposed, one that could enable mapping of underground utilities using limited information available in the form of different sources of data and knowledge.</p>", "keywords": ["artificial intelligence", "virtual sensing", "underground utilities", "buried utilities", "data fusion", "knowledge database", "NEURAL-NETWORK", "GPR", "CLASSIFICATION", "RECOGNITION", "UNDERWORLD", "ALGORITHMS", "OBJECTS", "IMAGES"]}, "66": {"doi": "10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101827", "wos_id": "WOS:000588052000257", "journal": "JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING", "title": "Deep learning in the construction industry: A review of present status and future innovations", "pubyear": "2020", "abstract": "<p>The construction industry is known to be overwhelmed with resource planning, risk management and logistic challenges which often result in design defects, project delivery delays, cost overruns and contractual disputes.

Design/methodology/approach The science mapping-based scientometric analysis was systematically processed with 1,835 CPM-related journal articles retrieved from Scopus. The co-authorship analysis and direct citation analysis were carried out to identify the most influential researchers, countries and publishers of the knowledge domain. The co-occurrence analysis of keyword was assessed to reveal the most dominating research topics and research trend with the visual representation of the considered research domain. Findings This study reveals seven clusters of main research topics from the keyword co-occurrence analysis. The evolution of research confirms that CPM-related research studies were mainly focused on fundamental and traditional CPM research topics before 2007. The period between 2007 and 2020 has seen a shift of research efforts towards digitalization and automation. The result suggests Building Information Modelling (BIM) as the most common, growing and influential research topic in the CPM research domain.

In remote sensing image analysis, the images captured through satellite and drones are used to observe surface of the Earth. The main aim of any image classification-based system is to assign semantic labels to captured images, and consequently, using these labels, images can be arranged in a semantic order. The semantic arrangement of images is used in various domains of digital image processing and computer vision such as remote sensing, image retrieval, object recognition, image annotation, scene analysis, content-based image analysis, and video analysis. The earlier approaches for remote sensing image analysis are based on low-level and mid-level feature extraction and representation. These techniques have shown good performance by using different feature combinations and machine learning approaches. These earlier approaches have used small-scale image dataset. The recent trends for remote sensing image analysis are shifted to the use of deep learning model. Various hybrid approaches of deep learning have shown much better results than the use of a single deep learning model. In this review article, a detailed overview of the past trends is presented, based on low-level and mid-level feature representation using traditional machine learning concepts. A summary of publicly available image benchmarks for remote sensing image analysis is also presented. A detailed summary is presented at the end of each section.
