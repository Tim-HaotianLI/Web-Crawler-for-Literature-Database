Robotics, as a powerful technology to improve productivity in the digitization era, is being used to assist in addressing these problems. Particularly in recent years, interest in construction robotics research has risen remarkably. To gain a deeper understanding of this burgeoning research field, this study provides a bibliometric analysis of 498 related papers retrieved from WoS (Web of Science). Performance analysis and science mapping were used in the paper to identify the research trends, relationship among authors, top publication sources, regional activities, as well as knowledge base and dominant research sub-fields. The results indicated that the number of papers focusing on construction robotics has been continuously growing since 2013. \u201cAutomation,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and \u201cdesign\u201d have been the most addressed topics in construction robotics. The findings are indicative of identifying the deficiencies in existing research and provide directions for future research. Those include greater attention paid to the experimental results of on-site construction robots, while ignoring the impacts of practical construction situations, and the development of off-site construction robots needs more support. For theoretical research, there is a lack of studies on human\u2013robot collaboration workflow and management models. Therefore, the study would be valuable in providing practitioners and researchers with a better perspective on the development of construction robotics and facilitating the building of the intellectual wealth of robotics in the construction industry."}, "2": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-13622", "journal": "Journal of Construction Engineering and Management", "title": "Evaluation of Lean Off-Site Construction Literature through the Lens of Industry 4.0 and 5.0", "pubyear": "2023", "abstract": "Lean manufacturing principles are being increasingly employed in off-site construction (OSC) with the primary objective of reducing waste and improving production efficiency.

This study aims to evaluate extant literature employing lean tools and concepts in OSC toward the realization of I4.0 and I5.0 design principles, identifying key research themes and gaps and suggesting future directions. A mixed-method review was employed to first identify highly relevant literature using a bibliometric search.

Results highlight several interactions between identified lean-OSC tools and concepts and I4.0 and I5.0 design principles, signifying the power of these tools/concepts in meeting multiple industry objectives. The review also identifies a significant overlap between the resilience principle in I5.0 and many of the I4.0 principles, emphasizing resilience as an integrative concept of technological principles.

Previous research on construction safety training has made significant progress, but existing literature reviews lack a comprehensive summary of the development of construction safety training, an evaluation of the effectiveness of current training methods, and an analysis of potential improvements in the future. Therefore, this study addresses these challenges through systematic literature review, scientometric analysis, and meta-analysis. A total of 92 publications since 2001 were included in this study after searching and selection based on the preferred reporting items commonly used in psychological and medical systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This study identified three phases of construction safety training research: determination of the necessity and significance of construction safety training, exploration of different methods for construction safety training, and development of construction safety training tools using advanced technologies. Findings from the scientometric analysis revealed that prevention and hazard recognition are key research topics in the field. Critical findings of prevention and hazard recognition were summarized and discussed to have a comprehensive understanding of current progress. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that current safety training methods are generally effective in improving construction safety, though the effectiveness in field studies is lower than in laboratory studies. Thus, researchers should understand why safety training performance is different between laboratories and construction sites and then control the differences to enhance the effectiveness of construction safety training in the future. This study identified that personalized safety training is a foreseeable development trend and suggested more efforts on the improvement of long-term safety training effectiveness. Additionally, safety training methods should be revised and optimized for the needs of intelligent construction and prefabricated construction. These findings offer new insights into construction safety training for researchers and policymakers."}, "4": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JPEODX.PVENG-1291", "journal": "Journal of Transportation Engineering", "title": "Pavement Monitoring Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: An Overview", "pubyear": "2023", "abstract": "Pavement monitoring involves periodic damage detection and condition assessment of pavements for efficient pavement management.

The purpose of this review is to theoretically explain the low uptake of MMC in the public sector by exploring the relative pressure points that are contributing to clients\u2019 indecision. The study argues the five functional constructs of the diffusion of innovation theory against MMC attributes. A systematic review of 67 articles through a preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) led to key arguments that explain the lesser drive for MMC adoption. Results reveal that previous literature plurally discards the dynamics between supply and demand, decision-making, and supply's business models. An improved understanding of these dynamics would, therefore, support research efforts in disclosing the necessary considerations to promote clients\u2019 favorable innovation decisions.

Geotechnical reliability can be broadly defined as a methodology that enhances decision making at different life-cycle stages covering design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofit, and decommission/reuse by exploiting the richer characterization of data using probabilistic models. Besides engineered systems, it also covers the risk assessment and management of geohazards such as earthquakes and landslides. Various application areas related to the design and construction stages of engineered systems can be put in context in the form of an uncertainty-informed Burland Triangle. Among these application areas, the estimation of a characteristic value, load and resistance factor design (LRFD), resistance factor calibration for simplified reliability-based design (RBD), and first-order second-moment (FOSM) reliability analysis do not need in-depth knowledge/expertise in reliability and a significant amount of information exists to support these applications in practice. This paper argues for their adoption because they will nudge a mindset shift to be more responsive to data. Data infrastructure is now considered to be as important as physical infrastructure. The concern that there are insufficient data for probabilistic analysis has also been largely and comprehensively resolved by recent advances in Bayesian machine learning methods that can deal with MUSIC-3X (Multivariate, Uncertain and Unique, Sparse, Incomplete, and potentially Corrupted with \u201c3X\u201d denoting 3D spatial variability) site data directly. Sparsity (insufficient data) is only one out of six attributes in a real-world MUSIC-3X data set. Geotechnical reliability is now pictured as one important step toward digital transformation and engaging complex new challenges posed by climate change and resilience engineering. This paper urges the geotechnical engineering profession to lay aside its questions on quantity, quality, and/or other \u201cugly\u201d attributes and offer our data an opportunity to speak for itself.

However, LoS is observed to be deteriorating on urban roads, especially near signalized intersections, primarily due to the suboptimal operation of traffic signals. To achieve optimal performance of traffic signals, knowledge about the traffic states prevalent in the vicinity of the intersection is essential. Traffic states in general can be estimated at both macroscopic and microscopic level by employing various mathematical and data-driven approaches. However, obtaining these variables near the intersection is difficult and challenging under varying traffic conditions. This paper presents a systematic review of the state of the art in traffic state estimation (TSE) near signalized intersections both under homogeneous, lane-based, and heterogeneous less lane disciplined (HLLD) traffic conditions. This is expected to be a guide to traffic engineers, decision makers, and researchers aiming to gain pertinent knowledge about the sensors that can be used, data that needs to be collected, estimation methods that are suitable, and the intersection performance measures that need to be evaluated. The gaps in the current state of the art and future research directions are highlighted.

Continuous monitoring of their condition is crucial for the efficient operation of transportation facilities. Conventional bridge monitoring has relied on direct sensor instrumentation on the bridge to obtain the bridge response. Indirect bridge health monitoring (iBHM) leverages the moving traffic over the specific bridge of interest. The benefit of iBHM lies in the fact that bridge instrumentation is no longer required since the moving vehicle is instrumented with sensors. The collected data can be used to identify the dynamic characteristics of the bridge. Additionally, the method can be used to detect damage using the information of the vehicle bridge interaction. This paper systematically reviews the recent research progress in iBHM, and the review is organized based on four main groups, namely single test vehicles, tractor-trailer vehicles, crowdsourced/smartphone monitoring, and contact point (CP) response.

This study explored whether and how BIM adoption can help minimize the chronic problem of dispute in the industry. A structured critical literature review method was employed in this study which involved 102 papers in the fields of BIM and construction disputes. Nine main common causes of disputes (e.g.,\u00a0change order, design error, site problem, contractual problem, payment problem, and delay) and eight primary benefits of BIM application (e.g.,\u00a0improved visual management, design optimization, improved information management, and enhanced collaboration) were identified. A conceptual framework was developed illustrating the mechanism of adopting BIM to facilitate dispute management in the overall life cycle of construction projects. The framework indicates that design error, delay, and change order can be reduced most significantly by most of the BIM benefits, whereas improved visual management, improved information management, and enhanced collaboration are three of the most frequently adopted BIM benefits that can settle the majority of dispute causes. This study contributes to dispute management with a more holistic view of adopting BIM in the life cycle of construction projects, as illustrated in the conceptual framework.

We define a virtual testbed as an environment with enough supporting architecture and metadata to be representative of one or more systems such that the testbed can be used to design experiments, examine model or system integration, and test theories. Testbeds enable researchers to assess multidisciplinary integrated community resilience models, thereby helping decision makers to make better community hazard mitigation plans and recovery decisions. This paper leverages the current momentum on using virtual testbeds for community resilience analysis to dissect what testbeds are in practice. To obtain consensus on the presented definition of a testbed, the paper conducted a virtual survey with testbed experts. The survey primarily explored how testbeds have been used across different disciplines, how testbeds differ from case studies, and what are the minimum requirements for a testbed. The paper, then, presents findings from a systematic literature review on 22 identified existing community resilience testbeds and 103 associated publications. According to the literature review and survey results, community resilience testbeds should have both a hazard module and a community module that ideally includes physical, social, and economic systems. The literature review concludes with a discussion on the available tools for testbed development, typical challenges testbed developers encounter, and areas for future testbed research.

The review specifically addresses four research questions aligned with the framework to synthesize previous research activities, and the paper proposes five directions that depict future research and practices: integrated AIR for large-scale modularization, multi-dimensional project management, intelligent postconstruction management, interdisciplinarity and interoperability, and moving beyond technical solutions. The findings and the philosophical framework should benefit succeeding exploration and practice in the field."}, "22": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ST.1943-541X.0003392", "journal": "Journal of Structural Engineering", "title": "Machine Learning for Risk and Resilience Assessment in Structural Engineering: Progress and Future Trends", "pubyear": "2022", "abstract": "Population growth, economic development, and rapid urbanization in many areas have led to increased exposure and vulnerability of structural and infrastructure systems to hazards. Thus, developing risk-based assessment and management tools is crucial for stakeholders and the general public to make informed decisions on prehazard planning and posthazard recovery. To this end, structural risk and resilience assessment has been an ongoing research topic in the past 20\u00a0years. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have been shown as promising tools for advancing the risk and resilience assessment of structure and infrastructure systems. To date, however, there is a lack of a holistic review on ML progress across various branches of structural engineering; an in-depth analysis of literature that can provide a timely evaluation of risk and resilience assessment methods of the built environment, where different types of structural and infrastructure facilities are interconnected. For this reason, this study conducted a comprehensive review on ML for risk and resilience assessment in four main branches of structural engineering (buildings, bridges, pipelines, and electric power systems). To cover the crucial modules in the prevailing risk and resilience assessment frameworks, existing literature is thoroughly examined and characterized in terms of six attributes of ML, including method, task type, data source, analysis scale, event type, and topic area. Moreover, limitations and challenges are identified, and future research needs are highlighted to move forward the frontiers of ML for structural risk and resilience assessment."}, "23": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29SC.1943-5576.0000703", "journal": "Practice Periodical on Structural Design and Construction", "title": "Structural Health Monitoring Techniques and Technologies for Large-Scale Structures: Challenges, Limitations, and Recommendations", "pubyear": "2022", "abstract": "Engineers, building officials and authorities, developers, and other stakeholders have long recognized the significance of structural health monitoring (SHM) in civil infrastructure.

However, all SHM applications face challenges and limitations in several aspects. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of such challenges and limitations, and sheds light on some future research needs and directions. The most widely used frameworks and their respective limitations are presented and discussed with a focus on real-life applications pertaining to large structures. Driven by many recent technological advancements, SHM systems are shifting away from conventional, contact-based sensors in favor of more efficient, non-contact-based sensors. This is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but rather a stepping-stone and pathway to a solid understanding of the SHM field and its current intricacies pertaining to large structures.

The analytic perspective illuminates the applicability of network methods to megaproject issues in detailed subknowledge areas, including stakeholder management, risk management, communication, coordination and collaboration, knowledge management, and interface management. Furthermore, these two perspectives were generalized and converged into pure categories of network research, including network mechanisms and antecedents, network patterns and dynamics, network functions and outcomes, and network controls and optimization.

Those that have been implemented often find difficulty in differentiating disruption from incidents and contextual factors such as sporting events or public holidays. This has caused unnecessary false alerts to be triggered, leading to dissatisfied operators. Progress could be made if more research data and IDAs were published, allowing for thorough evaluations and comparisons of algorithm performance on real-world data. Further research is required to improve IDAs\u2019 ability to differentiate between incidents and contexts, particularly in complex urban networks."}, "43": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HY.1943-7900.0001658", "journal": "Journal of Hydraulic Engineering", "title": "Overview of Large-Scale Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Modeling of Dam Hydraulics", "pubyear": "2019", "abstract": "The design of appurtenant structures for dams, such as spillways, is a complex task because of the turbulent high-velocity aerated nature of the flowing water. In previous years, physical models would have been the only practical tool available to gain insight into the three-dimensional and time-dependent nature of spillway flows. Now, hydropower dam designers have multiple engineering tools to assess the hydraulic behavior in spillway structures. The high complexity level of these flows challenges the capabilities of computational fluid dynamics methods. Within this scope, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method appears as a quite appropriate solution to solve flows dealing with large deformations, complex geometries, and movable boundaries. It has been used in a wide range of applications, including dam spillways. This paper provides an overview of how this method has been applied to investigate flow features in real spillways within the past decade. Its current state of knowledge with relevance to dam engineering practice is addressed and current limitations are highlighted in sight of future research could resolve them."}, "44": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CO.1943-7862.0001749", "journal": "Journal of Construction Engineering and Management", "title": "State-of-the-Art Review on Mixed Reality Applications in the AECO Industry", "pubyear": "2019", "abstract": "The ability to combine digital information with the real world enables mixed reality (MR) technology to provide a better display of information, resulting in its increasing popularity in various fields. The architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry is no exception. However, existing reviews on the use of MR technology can hardly keep up with the rapid development of MR applications. Therefore, a state-of-the-art review focusing on MR technology applications in the AECO industry is needed to reflect the current status of MR implementation in the AECO industry. This review is based on articles retrieved from well-acknowledged academic journals within the domain of the AECO industry. In this paper, 87 journal papers on MR applications are identified and classified into four categories: (1)\u00a0applications in architecture and engineering, (2)\u00a0applications in construction, (3)\u00a0applications in operation, and (4)\u00a0applications in multiple stages. Five basic components of MR, including spatial registration, display, user interaction, data storage, and multiuser collaboration, in each of the aforementioned 87 journal papers are identified and discussed. After reviewing the selected applications and corresponding MR components, this paper summarizes the challenges of MR development and provides insights into future trends of the MR technology in four aspects, namely: (1)\u00a0accuracy of spatial registration, (2)\u00a0user interface (UI), (3)\u00a0data storage and transfer, and (4)\u00a0multiuser collaboration."}, "45": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0000722", "journal": "Journal of Management in Engineering", "title": "Tension between Leadership Archetypes: Systematic Review to Inform Construction Research and Practice", "pubyear": "2019", "abstract": "In the literature on construction projects, the role of project managers in maintaining control over tasks and activities has been theorized comprehensively, placing a firm focus on vertical forms of leadership. Increasingly, construction firms are challenged with unprecedented operational uncertainty brought about by changes to project environments, technology, and labor. Similar challenges in other contexts have led to growing research on shared or horizontal approaches to leadership, which have been particularly effective in making organizations more agile in uncertain environments. Through a systematic review of 290 peer-reviewed articles on leadership in construction, this paper considers the extent to which traditional vertical approaches to leadership are supplemented with horizontal and emerging balanced approaches to leadership across six bodies of construction leadership research. It contends that despite evidence for the increasing implementation of horizontal leadership practices on construction projects, vertical leadership theory dominates construction leadership research. In comparison, there is a dearth of research addressing horizontal leadership and scarce consideration of balanced leadership. Based on the review, stronger integration of the balanced leadership archetype in research on leadership in construction is proposed as a logical means of advancing leadership theory in relation to six research vectors."}, "46": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29CO.1943-7862.0001708", "journal": "Journal of Construction Engineering and Management", "title": "Wearable Sensing Technology Applications in Construction Safety and Health", "pubyear": "2019", "abstract": "The advent of wearable sensing technologies has produced unprecedented opportunities for the near real-time collection and analysis of workers\u2019 safety and health data. To encourage the proactive safety management these opportunities present, extensive research efforts have explored using various wearable sensing technologies\u2014including motion sensors (e.g.,\u00a0inertial measurement units) and physiological sensors (e.g.,\u00a0heart-rate sensors, electrodermal-activity sensors, skin-temperature sensors, eye trackers, and brainwave monitors)\u2014to detect potential safety hazards and to continuously monitor a worker\u2019s health on a construction jobsite. However, these efforts tend to be piecemeal or fragmented, which presents a challenge for both the practitioners and the researchers who wish to fully understand the current developments in this area. In this context, this paper provides a critical review of the state of the art of wearable applications in construction safety and health. The review first identifies five general applications within the literature: preventing musculoskeletal disorders, preventing falls, assessing physical workload and fatigue, evaluating hazard-recognition abilities, and monitoring workers\u2019 mental status. Second, this study identifies the challenges impeding further development and deployment of wearable applications, specifically, signal artifacts and noise in wearable-sensors\u2019 field measurements, variable standards for personal safety and health risks in construction, users\u2019 resistance to technology adoption, and uncertainty regarding the return on investment. Lastly, this paper recommends future research opportunities for advancing the field, especially in terms of conducting sensor fusion for wearable applications, developing a business case, and engaging wearables in risk assessment and post-injury compensability assessment."}, "47": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29IS.1943-555X.0000507", "journal": "Journal of Infrastructure Systems", "title": "Synergizing Roadway Infrastructure Investment with Digital Infrastructure for Infrastructure-Based Connected Vehicle Applications: Review of Current Status and Future Directions", "pubyear": "2019", "abstract": "The safety, mobility, environmental, energy, and economic benefits of transportation systems, which are the focus of recent connected vehicle (CV) programs, are potentially dramatic. However, realization of these benefits largely hinges on the timely integration of digital technology into upcoming as well as existing transportation infrastructure. CVs must be enabled to broadcast and receive data to and from other CVs [vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication], to and from infrastructure [vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication], and to and from other road users, such as bicyclists or pedestrians (vehicle-to-other road users communication). Further, the infrastructure and transportation agencies that manage V2I-focused applications must be able to collect, process, distribute, and archive these data quickly, reliably, and securely. This paper focuses on V2I applications and investigates current digital roadway infrastructure initiatives. It highlights the importance of including digital infrastructure investment alongside investment in more traditional transportation infrastructure to keep up with the auto industry\u2019s push toward increasing intervehicular communication. By studying current CV testbeds and smart-city initiatives, this paper identifies digital infrastructure components (i.e.,\u00a0communication options and computing infrastructure) being used by public agencies. It also examines public agencies\u2019 limited budgeting for digital infrastructure and finds that current expenditure is inadequate for realizing the potential benefits of V2I applications. Finally, the paper presents a set of recommendations, based on a review of current practices and future needs, designed to guide agencies responsible for transportation infrastructure. It stresses the importance of collaboration for establishing national and international platforms for the planning, deployment, and management of digital infrastructure to support connected transportation systems across political jurisdictions."}, "48": {"doi": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29AE.1943-5568.0000337", "journal": "Journal of Architectural Engineering", "title": "State-of-the-Art Review of Energy Smart Homes", "pubyear": "2018", "abstract": "With advancement in sensor, control, and communication technologies, homes can\n                    now be equipped with more intelligent lighting, HVAC, entertainment, and\n                    safety/security systems, as well as appliances with many advanced features,\n                    including high energy efficiency.
