These challenges have instigated research in the application of advanced machine learning algorithms such as deep learning to help with diagnostic and prescriptive analysis of causes and preventive measures. However, the publicity created by tech firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon about Artificial Intelligence and applications to unstructured data is not the end of the field. There abound many applications of deep learning, particularly within the construction sector in areas such as site planning and management, health and safety and construction cost prediction, which are yet to be explored. The overall aim of this article was to review existing studies that have applied deep learning to prevalent construction challenges like structural health monitoring, construction site safety, building occupancy modelling and energy demand prediction. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no extensive survey of the applications of deep learning techniques within the construction industry. This review would inspire future research into how best to apply image processing, computer vision, natural language processing techniques of deep learning to numerous challenges in the industry.

Key observations from the consolidated literature were that (1) when leveraging computer vision methods, automatic mapping techniques vastly focus on manholes localized from aerial imagery; (2) when applied to non-intrusive sensing, AI methods vastly focus on empowering ground-penetrating radar (GPR)-produced data; and (3) data fusion techniques to produce utility maps should be extended to any utility assets/types.

First, using Digital Twins to detect building faults to prevent future failures and cutting overall costs by improving building maintenance is still ambiguous. Second, how Digital Twin technology may be applied to discover inefficiencies inside the building to optimize energy usage is not well defined.
