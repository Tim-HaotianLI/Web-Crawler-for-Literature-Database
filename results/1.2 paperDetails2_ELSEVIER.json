The diagnosis of autoimmune blistering skin diseases is based on lesions examination and requires extensive, algorithmic array of immunologic investigations that are available in a few selected centers only and are cost intensive.

While the collection of as-built utility locations is becoming more accurate, there still exists an important need to be capable of accurately detecting buried utilities in order to eliminate risks associated with digging. Current practices typically involve the use of trained agents to survey and detect underground utilities at locations of interest, which is a costly and time-consuming process. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI), an opportunity arose in conducting virtual sensing of buried utilities by combining robotics (e.g., drones), knowledge, and logic. This paper reviewed methods that are based on AI in mapping underground infrastructure. In particular, the use of AI in aerial and terrestrial mapping of utility assets was reviewed, followed by a summary of AI techniques used in fusing multi-source data in creating underground infrastructure maps. Key observations from the consolidated literature were that (1) when leveraging computer vision methods, automatic mapping techniques vastly focus on manholes localized from aerial imagery; (2) when applied to non-intrusive sensing, AI methods vastly focus on empowering ground-penetrating radar (GPR)-produced data; and (3) data fusion techniques to produce utility maps should be extended to any utility assets/types.

The pipeline of traditional VSLAM methods based on classical image processing algorithms consists of six main steps, including initialization (data acquisition), feature extraction, feature matching, pose estimation, map construction, and loop closure. Since 2017, deep learning has changed this approach from individual steps to implementation as a whole. Currently, three ways are developing with varying degrees of integration of deep learning into traditional VSLAM systems: (1) adding auxiliary modules based on deep learning, (2) replacing the original modules of traditional VSLAM with deep learning modules, and (3) replacing the traditional VSLAM system with end-to-end deep neural networks. The first way is the most elaborate and includes multiple algorithms. The other two are in the early stages of development due to complex requirements and criteria.

Objective: By reviewing the latest development and patent of Computer Vision SLAM, this paper provides references to researchers in related fields. Methods: Computer Vision SLAM patents and literature were analyzed from the aspects of the algorithm, innovation, and application. Among them, there are more than 30 patents and nearly 30 pieces of literature in the past ten years.

Those installations are installed in the Faculty of Letters, Science, the Presidency and CFC. The later used in our study, have different parameters. Hence, to collect these parameters and their distinct data we used multiple sources. The datasheets of each components of the PV system contains the parameters that distinguish the devices therefore it was mandatory to look for that information, since it will facilitate our study. The meteorological database PVGIS, was our reference for the temperature and irradiation data. What's more is the PVSYST software that helps in the simulation of the PV system and thus having a detailed report with massive information. All this collection of data was aiming to help us comparing the results of yields and other parameters by manual calculation versus simulation in PVSYST.

The accurate identification of changes in behavior is a time-consuming task for caretakers in large, commercial pig production systems and requires strong observational skills and a working knowledge of animal husbandry and livestock systems operations. In recent years, many studies have explored the use of various technologies and sensors to assist animal caretakers in monitoring animal activity and behavior. Of these technologies, computer vision offers the most consistent promise as an effective aid in animal care, and yet, a systematic review of the state of application of this technology indicates that there are many significant barriers to its widespread adoption and successful utilization in commercial production system settings. One of the most important of these barriers is the recognition of the sources of errors from objective behavior labeling that are not measurable by current algorithm performance evaluations. Additionally, there is a significant disconnect between the remarkable advances in computer vision research interests and the integration of advances and practical needs being instituted by scientific experts working in commercial animal production partnerships. This lack of synergy between experts in the computer vision and animal health and production sectors means that existing and emerging datasets tend to have a very particular focus that cannot be easily pivoted or extended for use in other contexts, resulting in a generality versus particularity conundrum. This goal of this paper is to help catalogue and consider the major obstacles and impediments to the effective use of computer vision associated technologies in the swine industry by offering a systematic analysis of computer vision applications specific to commercial pig management by reviewing and summarizing the following: (i) the purpose and associated challenges of computer vision applications in pig behavior analysis; (ii) the use of computer vision algorithms and datasets for pig husbandry and management tasks; (iii) the process of dataset construction for computer vision algorithm development. In this appraisal, we outline common difficulties and challenges associated with each of these themes and suggest possible solutions. Finally, we highlight the opportunities for future research in computer vision applications that can build upon existing knowledge of pig management by extending our capability to interpret pig behaviors and thereby overcome the current barriers to applying computer vision technologies to pig production systems.

The statistics of international civil aviation organization show that global air traffic is approximately doubled every fifteen years, and the existing air traffic navigation system is close to saturation. The existing air traffic management (ATM) systems automatically acquire and process air traffic control information for air traffic controller, through surveillance data fusion, flight data processing, meteorology and aeronautical information processing and safety nets processing. However, the limited decision-making support ability leads to the low intelligent degree of ATM system, which can't meet the need of the future development of ATM. In order to adapt to the rapid development of aviation industry in the future, some countries and organizations are committed to carrying out new technologies to solve the problems of air traffic safety, airspace congestion and flight delays. In 2004, the EU proposed the \"Single European Sky ATM Research(SESAR)\" program and proposed tore-plan European airspace to meet air traffic demand and improve the efficiency of ATM system. The key technologies of the program include four key areas of ATM: efficient airport operations, advanced air traffic services, optimized air traffic network services and reliable ATC infrastructure. In 2005, the United States proposed the next generation air transportation system(NEXTGEN), including ADS-B, data communication, en route automation modernization, terminal automation modernization and replacement, NAS voice system and system wide information management. In 2012, ICAO launched the aviation system block upgrade plan (ASBU). The ASBU involved four aviation performance improvement areas, including airport operations, globally interoperable systems and data, optimum capacity and flexible flights and efficient flight path. Each area consists of multiple threads and distributed in four blocks according to the implementation stage. CAAC is also implementing or planning a large number of ASBU modules to cope with the rapid development of Chinese civil aviation. The existing ATM system and its future planning mainly focus on the infrastructure construction, without enough intelligent applications. In recent years, with the support of deep learning, high performance computing and big data, artificial intelligence technology has been rapidly used in various fields. Especially, technologies of computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing have made breakthrough and rapid industrialization. Artificial intelligence, represented by deep learning, emphasizes that judgment and decision-making based on a large number of prior knowledge, which is consistent with the decision-making process of ATM. Therefore, artificial intelligence technology can promote the development of air traffic control key technologies, improve safety and the efficiency of air traffic control and reduce the workload of air traffic controller. The great benefit of the rapid development of artificial intelligence makes the intellectualized ATM a necessity. In this paper, the concept of intellectualized ATM and the overall framework of intellectualized ATM system were presented. The overall framework of intellectualized ATM includes the perception layer, network layer, platform layer, application layer and visual layer. All kinds of communication, navigation, surveillance, weather, wireless, video capture, radio frequency identification and other facilities of the perception layer offer the infrastructures for ATM. The network layer transmits information by using special line network, satellite communication network, Internet, mobile network and so on. The platform layer achieves information storage, sharing and mining by using of SWIM, cloud computing, intelligent big data mining. Application layer studies the application of artificial intelligence technology in air traffic control, airspace management, air traffic flow management, flight service, general aviation and unmanned aerial vehicle. The visual layer provides efficient and intelligent interaction through the portal, virtual visualization, intelligent UI and mobile applications. The research direction of intellectualized ATM includes intelligent ATM data processing, intelligent decision-making, air traffic control speech recognition and air traffic control robot. The intelligent ATM data processing involves various kinds of ATM data acquisition, processing, transmission, interaction and intelligent mining. Intelligent decision-making focuses on intelligent conflict management, intelligent air traffic flow management, intelligent planning and management, intelligent AMAN and DMAN, intelligent airport operation, etc. In view of the important role of ground-to-air communication in air traffic control, the intelligent simulation pilot and air traffic control safety monitoring based on automatic speech recognition should be studied. The intellectualized ATM system has the capabilities of air traffic control perception, planning, reasoning and action based on artificial intelligence.

In this paper, it is hypothesized that the future of infrastructure relies on smarter information; the rich information obtained from embedded sensors within infrastructure will act as a catalyst for new design, construction, operation and maintenance processes for integrated infrastructure systems linked directly with user behaviour patterns.

Despite extensive research on this topic, it still suffers from difficulties in handling complex object appearance changes caused by factors such as illumination variation, partial occlusion, shape deformation, and camera motion. Therefore, effective modeling of the 2D appearance of tracked objects is a key issue for the success of a visual tracker. In the literature, researchers have proposed a variety of 2D appearance models. To help readers swiftly learn the recent advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we contribute this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D appearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking. In this survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two different processing stages: visual representation and statistical modeling. Then, different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with respect to their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of interest as well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic. The contributions of this survey are fourfold. First, we review the literature of visual representations according to their feature-construction mechanisms (i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-constructionmechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative. Third, each type of visual representations or statisticalmodeling techniques is analyzed and discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint.

In most of the existing methods, three-dimensional (3D) invariants have been obtained by reconstruction of the object structure, where fundamental matrices between image pairs should be first established. Consequently, there are additional errors introduced during invariants construction and could be very time consuming. In this paper, a novel algorithm to calculate 3D projective invariants from multiple images has been proposed, without reconstructing the object structures explicitly. We have employed the geometric configuration of points and lines in general position to deduce the formulation of 3D invariants. It has been verified in our experiments that our proposed method is considerably accurate when compared with the ground truth, and more efficient when compared with reconstruction based methods. \u00a9 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.", "keywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Geometric invariants", "multi-view geometry", "projective invariants"]}, "72": {"doi": "10.1088/1741-2560/4/2/R02", "journal": "Journal of Neural Engineering", "title": "Prosthetic interfaces with the visual system: Biological issues", "pubyear": "2007", "abstract": "The design of effective visual prostheses for the blind represents a challenge for biomedical engineers and neuroscientists.

Blind patients with the retinal degenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are a common population in clinical trials of visual prostheses. The visual performance abilities of normals and RP patients are compared. To generate pattern vision in blind patients, the visual prosthetic interface must effectively stimulate the retinotopically organized neurons in the central visual field to elicit patterned visual percepts. The development of more biologically compatible methods of stimulating visual system neurons is critical to the development of finer spatial percepts.

Essential bases for the simulator were the sensor simulation and surveillance functions. Simulated ASDE, a Mode-S multi-lateration system, and a D-GPS formed the sensors that provided input for the surveillance function, which had the possibility to specify a track-loss and track-swap ratio.
